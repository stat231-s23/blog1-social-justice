# Intro

This is an R Markdown blog template. This document will be knit to HTML to produce a webpage that will be hosted publicly via GitHub.

Amherst students have a wide range of interests, hobbies, and experiences. With a student body of only 1600, Amherst prides itself on this diversity. How is this diversity reflected in student writing? And what does this tell us about the priorities of the student body? To answer these questions, we analyzed 100 articles from the opinion section of [The Student](https://www.amherststudent.com/), the student magazine at Amherst College. The opinion section spans a large pool of topics, from health, to policy, to politics. We looked at the breakdown of these articles by subject matter, as well as the most common words and phrases referenced by these articles. We grouped articles by sentiment and emotion, and noticed changes in these areas over the past 8 months. 

```{r, fig.cap='"Two issues of the Amherst Student from January 1960 (right) and April 2023 (left)', out.width="80%", fig.align="left"}

```



## Website publication work flow

1. Edit Rmd

2. Knit to HTML to view progress. You may need to click "Open in Browser" for some content to show (sometimes content won't show until you actually push your changes to GitHub and view the published website).

3. Commit and push changes when you are ready. The website may take a couple minutes to update automatically after the push, but you may need to clear your browser's cache or view the page in a private/incognito window to see the changes more quickly. 


# Categorizing by Topic

You can include text, `code`, and output as usual. Remember to take full advantage of Markdown and follow our [Style Guide](https://acstat231-f22.github.io/home/style-guide.html#Text_narration).

Our dataset includes 100 articles from the Student, ranging from September 2022 to April 2023. We categorized each article by topic by looking at key words in each title. For example, the "health" category groups articles together that have the words "illness", "health", "ableism", "cancer", or "pandemic" in their title. The "policy" category groups articles that address some college policy, whether it be the open curriculum, the structure of the AAS, or J-term classes, to name a few. We observe that around 10% of the articles address college policy and 10% address politics. Articles about policy and politics are around twice as common as articles about health or finances. Articles about sports are very few, due to there being a separate sports section of the magazine. 

These topics are not mutually exclusive; for example, an article about the college's response to covid would be grouped under both "policy" and "health". 

```{r ggplot-example, fig.align="left", out.width="100%"}
opinions <- read_csv("data/opinions.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

Title = opinions %>% select("Title")
all_words_in_titles <- Title %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = Title)

policy <- all_words_in_titles %>% filter(word == "AAS" | word == "requirements" | word == "attendance"| word == "curriculum"| word == "constitution"| word == "j-term"| word == "mask"| word == "class"| word == "covid" | word == "space" | word == "policies" | word == "haven")

finances <- all_words_in_titles %>% filter(word == "aid" | word == "tuition"| word == "pay"| word == "money" | word == "fee" | word == "financial")

health <- all_words_in_titles %>% filter(word == "illness" | word == "health"| word == "ableism" | word == "cancer" | word == "pandemic" | word == "mask" | word == "bruce")

politics <- all_words_in_titles %>% filter(word == "macro-" | word == "tragedy" | word == "columbus" | word == "israel" | word == "insider" | word == "discourse")

sports <- all_words_in_titles %>% filter(word == "bruce" | word == "badminton")

topics <- c("policy", "health", "finances", "politics", "sports")
count <- c(as.numeric(count(policy)), as.numeric(count(health)), as.numeric(count(finances)), as.numeric(count(politics)), as.numeric(count(sports)))
title_topics <- data.frame(topics, count)
kable(title_topics)

ggplot(data = title_topics, aes(x= topics, y = count, color = topics, fill = topics)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(
    x = "Topics",
    y = "Number of articles",
    title = "Categorizing The Student articles by Title")

```

Examples and additional guidance are provided below. 

Take note of the the default code chunk options in the `setup` code chunk. For example, unlike the rest of the Rmd files we worked in this semester, the default code chunk option is `echo = FALSE`, so you will need to set `echo  = TRUE` for any code chunks you would like to display in the blog. You should be thoughtful and intentional about the code you choose to display. 

## Word and Phrase Frequency

What words and phrases are most common in the articles? We can plot the frequency of the most common words in the article bodies, after filtering out the stop-words (as, is, the, etc). "Student/s" and "Amherst" come out on top by a wide margin - no surprises there! "Student" is mentioned almost 400 times in just 100 articles. Other commonly appearing words are "time", "campus", and "college". 
```{r}
#finding most common terms in the body section
Body = opinions %>% select("Body")

all_words_in_body <- Body %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = Body)


body_words <- all_words_in_body %>% 
  filter(word != "student"  & word!= "it’s") %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by="word")

body_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, n), y = n, color = word, fill = word)) +
  geom_col() +
  # Rotate graph
  coord_flip() +
  guides(color = "none", 
         fill = "none") +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Number of instances",
    title = "Most common words in Amherst Student Opinion Articles")
```

```{r}
#creating word cloud

opinion_word_freqs <- opinions %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = Body) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(word != "student" & word != "it’s" & word != "i’m" & word != "don’t" & word != "i’ve") %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

#setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(100)

#choosing color palette
my_palette <- brewer.pal(10, "Dark2")

opinion_word_freqs %>%
  with(wordcloud(words = word,
      freq = n,
      min.freq = 20,
      max.words = 50,
    # Plot the words in a random order
      random.order = TRUE,
    # Specify the range of the size of the words
      scale = c(2, 0.3),
# Specify proportion of words with 90 degree rotation 
      rot.per = 0.15,
# Color words from least to most frequent
      colors = my_palette,
# Change font family
      family = "sans"))
```

We also looked at the most common bigrams, or two word phrases, in the Student. The three most common bigrams are "Student body", "latin honors", and "mental health". This is in agreement with Figure 1, which illustrates that policy and health lie among the most common article topics. 

```{r}
#finding most common bigrams (2-term phrases)
#creating bigram token 
opinions_bigrams <- Body %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = bigram, input = Body, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

opinions_bigrams_clean <- opinions_bigrams %>%
  separate(col="bigram", into=c("word1", "word2"), sep=" ", remove=FALSE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by=c("word1"="word")) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by=c("word2"="word")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(bigram)) %>%
  #removing irrelevant/uninformative bigrams
  filter((!grepl("amherst|editorial board|email protected|articles comment|emailing email", bigram))) %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1:10)

#plotting most common bigrams
ggplot(opinions_bigrams_clean, aes(x = fct_reorder(bigram, n), y = n
                                , color = bigram, fill = bigram)) +
geom_col() +
# Rotate graph 
  coord_flip() + guides(color = "none",
         fill = "none") +
  labs(
x = NULL,
    y = "Number of instances",
    title = "Most common bigrams in Amherst Student Opinion articles")
```

# Categorizing by Sentiment and Emotion

Do students primarily write negative or positive thoughts? 
## AFINN Lexicon
## NRC Lexicon 
## References 

You can include [links](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) using Markdown syntax as shown. 

You should include links to relevant sites as you write. You should additionally include a list of references as the end of your blog with full citations (and relevant links).


## Visualizations 

Visualizations, particularly interactive ones, will be well-received. That said, do not overuse visualizations. You may be better off with one complicated but well-crafted visualization as opposed to many quick-and-dirty plots. Any plots should be well-thought-out, properly labeled, informative, and visually appealing.

If you want to include dynamic visualizations or tables, you should explore your options from packages that are built from [**htmlwidgets**](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html). These **htmlwidgets**-based packages offer ways to build lighterweight, dynamic visualizations or tables that don't require an R server to run! A more complete list of packages is available on the linked website, but a short list includes:

* [**plotly**](https://plot.ly/r/): Interactive graphics with D3
* [**leaflet**](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): Interactive maps with OpenStreetMap
* [**dygraphs**](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs): Interactive time series visualization
* [**visNetwork**](http://dataknowledge.github.io/visNetwork): Network graph visualization vis.js
* [**sparkline**](https://github.com/htmlwidgets/sparkline): Small inline charts
* [**threejs**](https://github.com/bwlewis/rthreejs): Interactive 3D graphics
    
You may embed a published Shiny app in your blog if useful, but be aware that there is a limited window size for embedded objects, which tends to makes the user experience of the app worse relative to a dedicated Shiny app page. Additionally, Shiny apps will go idle after a few minutes and have to be reloaded by the user, which may also affect the user experience. 

Any Shiny apps embedded in your blog should be accompanied by the link to the published Shiny app (I did this using a figure caption in the code chunk below, but you don't have to incorporate the link in this way).

```{r ds-salaries-app, out.width = "100%", out.extra = 'data-external="1" frameborder="no"', fig.cap = "[Data Science Salaries Shiny App](https://bebailey.shinyapps.io/data-science-salaries)"}
knitr::include_app("https://bebailey.shinyapps.io/data-science-salaries",
                   height = "500px")
```


## Tables

### **DT** package

The [**DT** package](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) is great for making dynamic tables that can be displayed, searched, and filtered by the user without needing an R server or Shiny app!

Note: you should load any packages you use in the `setup` code chunk as usual. The `library()` functions are shown below just for demonstration.

```{r dt-example, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(DT)
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, cyl, hp) %>% 
  datatable(colnames = c("MPG", "Number of cylinders", "Horsepower"),
            filter = 'top',
            options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE))
```

### **kableExtra** package

You can also use [**kableExtra**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) for customizing HTML tables.

```{r kable-example, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance"),
      row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```


## Images

Images and gifs can be displayed using code chunks:

```{r, fig.cap='"Safe Space" by artist Kenesha Sneed', out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Kenesha-Sneed_safe-space.jpeg")
```


```{r, fig.cap="This is a figure caption", out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/H7ZrrA9V2pd3Tehdds/giphy.gif")
```

You may also use Markdown syntax for displaying images as shown below, but code chunks offer easier customization of the image size and alignment.

![This is another figure caption](https://media.giphy.com/media/8i5IvxP9ZLgmjXN1BF/giphy.gif)

Either way, the file path can be a local path within your project directory or a URL for an image hosted online. This syntax works for PNG, PDF, JPG, and even GIF formats.


## Videos

You can use code chunks or Markdown syntax include links to any valid YouTube or Vimeo URLs (see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/learnr-videos.html) for details) or point to a location within your project directory. 

Code chunk:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg")
```

Markdown syntax:

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8ODGFWgFg){width="90%"}


You may need to push your updates to GitHub to see if the videos work.




## Equations

You might include equations if part of the purpose of your blog is to explain a statistical method. There are two ways to include equations:

* Inline: $b \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b)$
* Display-style (displayed on its own line): 
$$\frac{\sigma^2_b}{\sigma^2_b + \sigma^2_e}$$

For typesetting equations appropriately, check out the [AMS-LaTeX quick reference](https://github.com/manuelemacchia/math-latex/blob/master/amsmath.pdf) or take a look at the *Symbols in math mode* section of this  [cheat sheet](https://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf)  (or do some extra Googling---there are *many* resources).



# Formatting

## Tabbed subsections {.tabset}

Each subsection below the "Tabbed subsections" section heading will appear in a tab. See R Markdown Cookbook [Section 7.6: Put content in tabs](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-tabs.html) for additional customization options. 

### Bulleted list

You can make a bulleted list like this:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3


### Numbered list


You can make a numbered list like this

1. First thing I want to say
2. Second thing I want to say
3. Third thing I want to say



## Column formatting

<!-- Begin columns environment -->

# Customizing your blog design


As a *final* detail **only** if you have time, you can explore options for customizing the style of your blog. By default, we are using the `readthedown` theme from the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) (see Line 6 of this file if you want to switch out themes).


## Theme
You can use the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) to play around with some pre-built themes. There are, I'm sure, many many many more similar packages with built in themes, or you can look into how to include a CSS code chunk to customize aspects of a theme.  

Using the **rmdformats** package, you can change the theme itself (Line 6): 

* `rmdformats::readthedown`
* `rmdformats::downcute` 
  * For `downcute` only, you can add a new indented line below Line 6 with the code `downcute_theme: "chaos"` for the `downcute chaos` theme
* `rmdformats::robobook` 
* `rmdformats::material`

You can explore additional YAML options by looking at the [**rmdformats** package](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) page or running, for example, `?rmdformats::readthedown()` to see the help documentation for a particular theme from the package. 

## Synax highlighting

You can also change the code chunk syntax highlighting option (Line 7, `highlight`): 

* `"default"`
* `"tango"`
* `"pygments"`
* `"kate"`
* `"monochrome"`
* `"espresso"`
* `"zenburn"`
* `"haddock"`
* `"textmate"` 
* `NULL` for no syntax highlighting (not recommended)

## Font size, type, and other customization

Further customization requires adding a CSS style file or code chunk or incorporating other development options. Customization beyond the **rmdformats** package should be your lowest and final priority for the project. Ensure your content is fully prepared first.


# References

All data sources, any key R packages, and any other sources used in developing your blog should be cited in full in a list of references at the end of your blog. Your blog post should also link to these sources as they are discussed. You may choose any reference style as long as sources are fully cited (try to be consistent!).

Typically, references in R Markdown (and LaTeX) files are [incorporated with a BibTeX database](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html) (a .bib file). You can try this approach or manually include either a numbered or alphabetized list. 

Columbia University has compiled some guidance on [how to cite data](https://guides.library.columbia.edu/datacitation). Some data sources will give you the citation information to copy and paste. Use the provided citations or citation styles in those cases.

You can list R package citations with the code `citation("packageName")` in the console and then copy (and reformat as needed) the relevant text, e.g.,
```{r}
citation("DT")
```

The following citations are based on the American Statistical Association citation style (not all of these references are used in this document).:
