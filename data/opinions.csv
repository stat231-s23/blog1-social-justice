2023-04-26,ChatGPT: Product Over Process?,"
No matter what classes you’re taking this semester, chances are high that conversations about AI have infiltrated your classrooms. While our cultural zeitgeist has been preoccupied with the rise of AI for decades, the advent of ChatGPT has made previously hypothetical discussions eerily tangible, particularly in academic circles. One in five college students nationwide has used ChatGPT to complete assignments. As such, it is necessary not only for our community to reflect on the changes ChatGPT will bring to our academic culture, but also for the college to lay the groundwork for regulation and adaptation.
After all, if programs such as ChatGPT can create an equivalent product to the work of actual students with none of the time and hassle, won’t that only further devalue the humanities, a discipline already in a precarious position? Is there even a need for human writers anymore? Perhaps this worry doesn’t seem so realistic in the present — the Editorial Board would argue that using ChatGPT in its current iteration would only be a detriment to one’s academic achievements. But as the writing and synthesizing capabilities of AI become stronger in coming years, it is necessary for us to reflect on what we value in the learning process and ensure that the productive capabilities of AI do not overshadow those values.
Take, for instance, academic writing. It may be tempting to use ChatGPT to complete essays, but in doing so, one completely bypasses the process of writing, much more important to a liberal arts education than the literal completed assignment. The value in human writing is not only the capacity for creativity and originality but the time and effort put in: the hours spent struggling with the material, discussing ideas with others, and synthesizing those ideas to form an argument. To let ChatGPT do that is not only to ruin your capacity for critical thinking and originality but to lose fundamental aspects of the student experience.
To some extent, therefore, in order to prevent our work from becoming indistinguishable from the algorithm’s, it is necessary for Amherst as a whole to undergo a cultural academic shift: Amherst classes should require us to be better than ChatGPT.
Too many writing-based classes at Amherst focus on the product of writing, rather than the process itself — that is to say, these classes involve assignments that require writing without incorporating the necessary analytical reasoning skills that will improve student writing in the long-term. This has three two consequences: firstly, it reduces the paper-writing process to its few pages of final product instead of a synthesis of ideas in collaboration with existing debates, nullifying the possibility for interesting and original thought. Secondly, it encourages procrastination and last-minute completion of assignments — creating the stressful environment that drives students to use ChatGPT in the first place.
One solution is for classes to de-emphasize writing projects in favor of oral assignments. A shift towards oral exams and presentations could more effectively teach students how to communicate ideas clearly and formulate arguments in real time. This could also be a greater emphasis on discussion in even lecture-based classes, facilitating student engagement with peers. Rather than having classes centered around writing four or five major papers over the course of the semester or 10 mini-response papers, classes with one or two major papers that focus on the process of creating those papers could be much more effective in fighting the influx of ChatGPT product-oriented writing. We acknowledge that this argument works better in some disciplines than others — classes in STEM departments, such as computer science, are often forced to decenter discussion due to the structure of their discipline. Rather than making any finalized arguments ourselves, we call upon each department to rethink the structure of their own classes in response to ChatGPT.
These responses can be positive as well. From generating practice problems for effective studying to helping draft the wording for emails and cover letters, ChatGPT could bring many benefits to students. But in order to maximize these benefits, students must have resources that can guide safe usage of ChatGPT, encouraging students to explore rather than live in fear of the dystopian AI.
Whatever decision the college makes in regards to regulating usage of ChatGPT, its relevance to our lives shows no signs of waning. The Editorial Board believes that the administration must show their dedication to this issue, considering its potential ramifications on education at Amherst and nationwide. Most importantly, academic departments need to take active steps to preserve the learning process and combat the dangers of AI usage.

2023-04-26,Tapti Talks: From Micro- to Macro-aggressions,"
I’ve attended a predominantly-white institution (PWI) for both my college and high school years. And being a Bangladeshi woman of color at PWIs comes with its fair share (as most BIPOC will know) of microaggressions.
This manifests in a couple of different ways. At Amherst, I’ve been called “Snigdha” twice, referring to my dear friend Snigdha Ranjan ’25, a fellow international student — but from India, not Bangladesh. Both times this occurred and I pointed out the mistake, it was justified with, “Oh I’m so sorry, you two look so alike.” But I don’t know how much I bought those arguments — beyond the numerous differences in our facial and bodily features, Snigdha has blue hair. Another time I was called “Muntaha” by an otherwise nice Community Safety Officer (CSO) — referring to Muntaha Mamun ’25 — who at the very least is Bangladeshi.
At the very least, members of the Amherst community have pinned down my identity in the Indian subcontinent. In high school, my friends of South Asian, West Asian, and North African descent seemed to be considered essentially interchangeable to a laughable degree — including one extraordinary moment in which the health center gave my daily medication to my friend, mistaking her Iranian features for my own.
It’s as funny as it isn’t. These interactions are mostly harmless — easily laughed off and really only brought up again for interesting party stories — but the above instance of my actual life-saving medication being given to someone else reveals that there are so many instances where this racialized “face-blindness” is incredibly dangerous. We could note the implications on an even greater scale: There are too many examples of the American justice system misidentifying perpetrators and sending innocent BIPOC people to prisons — too many wrongful convictions based on the inability of white people to distinguish POC faces.When white people can’t tell BIPOC faces apart, it can be life-threatening.
I don’t think that this mis-identification is necessarily racist, at its core. When I first came to the U.S. as a young teenager, having only lived in a homogenous South Asian country all my life, I found it difficult to distinguish white faces from one another at first — for the simple reason that I had never seen white features before. Part of the inability to distinguish POC faces stems from a similar innocent unfamiliarity — but how long can we allow people to hide behind the excuse of unfamiliarity? And what does it say about you, that you’re so caught up in your bubble that even in a diverse country like the U.S., you’re unable to distinguish BIPOC faces?
Conservative and racist rhetoric loves to accuse BIPOC of being obsessed with the color of their skin, that they can’t see people beyond race. But I can assure you that many of us don’t want to be aware of our race — we are forced to become aware when we enter a society that renders us an other. We develop a “dual consciousness” of sorts. That awareness starts at a different age for everyone — for me, I was lucky enough to not have to actively think about skin color until I came to the U.S. But that realization, and the resulting constant awareness of the way white society watches you, is exhausting.
Every negative interaction I’ve had with someone, every random glare from a stranger, I’ve had to ask myself, is it because I'm Brown? And most certainly I am overthinking, except I have had enough negative interactions — enough yells on the street and “Why is your name so weird?” and “Oh, wooooow your English is so good I’m so impressed” — that I’ve become distrustful of people. And honestly, I think that my experiences as non-Black POC have been for the most part innocuous; I know there are many people at Amherst who’ve had much worse experiences.
And that’s why I’m a little wary of the term “microaggression:” All these interactions are “micro”-aggressions, until they’re not. Until your professor gives you the wrong grade, having mixed you up with your friend. Until you’re constantly interrupted during discussion sections, with your classmates feeling nothing wrong with it. Until you realize that the theoretical academic conversations the people in your classes are having are real life matters to you. Until you’re forced to assimilate and give up aspects of your identity for sheer survival. Until sitting in an Amherst College dormitory, you are told that you were “most probably an affirmative action” admission, so don’t get too full of yourself.
My parents have always told me that the way to deal with microaggressions is to ignore them, (which is, admittedly, mostly what I end up doing) but I think a lot of people don’t realize how “macro” these “micro”-aggressions can become, how even these small comments and interactions can build up over time to threaten your sense of self and identity. Most people I know, myself included, often dismiss the microaggressions we face in our day to day life, not wanting to blow what are often harmless comments out of proportion. But in doing so, we become complacent in the ways society treats us and — excuse my cliché wording here — part of the problem. To say that microaggressions are only done by white people is purely false: Internal racism within POC communities is very real, and I’ve witnessed microaggressions from white and non-white people alike. If we don’t call out the microaggressions done to ourselves, how can we be allies and call out the microaggressions done to others?
The popular advice for avoiding making microaggressions is for us to “interrogate our biases,” explicit and implicit. I don’t disagree — but I think hand-in-hand with that comes the need to develop a culture of care — to value the individual for who they are. On this campus, I want to be seen as just another Amherst student, not just as a Brown person or international student or Bangladeshi or low-income student or any of the -isms and categories we are attached to. We are all here on this campus to learn and grow and hopefully succeed together — no need to make this journey even harder for ourselves and others."
2023-04-26,Rants and Raves: When Trader Joe’s Gets Corny,"
Like many Amherst students, I often use Trader Joe’s snacks and frozen meals to supplement my poor nutritional intake on Val’s pierogi or tequila lime chicken nights. I must admit: I am a Trader Joe’s lover. Its snacks aren’t too pricey, and its frozen meals are incredibly flavorful in comparison to Val’s bland meals. It also provides me with a breadth of foods that I otherwise would only have access to at a restaurant.
However, the same variety of flavors is also sometimes accompanied by questionable product design and culturally inaccurate recipes. In my semi-monthly special snack trips to the store, I find myself walking around the aisles and apprehensively staring at packages of culturally-coded snacks and wondering how appropriate the descriptions are. I’ve often stopped to stare at the “Philly Cheesesteak Bao Buns” in half-disgust, half-curiosity. As I eat my Trader Joe snacks, I can’t help but feel like I’m complicit in their lack of cultural respect, understanding that these foods are not truly representative of the meals they’re inspired by.

One of the snacks I’ve suspiciously peered at through the years are the “Giant Peruvian Inca Corn Snacks.” For starters, this name reads like a nonsensical string of words. Are the corn snacks giant, or is the corn itself? Or is it Peru that is giant? Is it Incan or Peruvian? Why couldn’t they choose one or the other? Why are the Incas relevant to the name of the snack?
I grew up eating fried white corn at Peruvian restaurants, where it is served as an appetizer and as a side for ceviche. It’s crunchy, salty, delicious and filling enough to keep you satisfied before a meal while being light enough to not fill you up like bread does. Fried white corn is traditionally served hot, and whenever it gets cold, it’s almost inedible — which is why a cold version of the snack was alarming. These concerns caused me to avoid picking this snack off the aisle, until a bout of curiosity and generous thinking made me want to try it out last week. Perhaps I was also hoping that this snack might provide me with a little piece of comfort.
When I opened the bag, I was hit with the realization that these snacks were oddly … puffed? Whereas normal fried corn is browned by toasting over a fire, this corn seemed to have a fluffy quality to them. When I tried them, I discovered that they were their own type of delicious, but that they had nothing to do with the hot snack I enjoyed as a child.
After finishing the bag, I looked at the back and saw the most gut-wrenching little blurb, detailing the origin of the bag: the “Sacred Valley of the Incas, Urubamba” –– a direct quotation from Wikipedia. Apparently, “you no longer need a llama to hit the high trails to track down” fried white corn, which actually exists in every single Peruvian restaurant that has ever existed.
This rant is by no means comprehensive to the issues that surround Trader Joes’ borderline appropriation of foods. Neither is it the most pressing issue that needs to be written about. However, there is an undeniably conflicting feeling that eating these snacks as a college student looking for a piece of home provides."
2023-04-20,My Vision for a New and Restructured AAS,"
Hello, Amherst family! If we have not had the opportunity to meet, my name is Shane, and I am your newly elected, soon to be sworn in, Association of Amherst Students (AAS) vice president (VP). My term will begin in the fall. I want to take an opportunity to introduce myself beyond what everyone already knows about me, outline some of the reasons I ran for VP, and tell you what my goals are for the next academic year. I am a low-income, queer student from Springfield, Massachusetts — so, relatively close. In my time on the AAS, I have served on the Budgetary Committee, Appointments Board, and Public Relations Committee. I was also a part of a group of senators who were working to help increase transparency from the Board of Trustees. Our efforts resulted in the board beginning to publish a publicly available summary of their quarterly meetings.
If I have learned anything from my past two semesters on senate, it is that we need to restructure our process. The senate does have productive conversations, but turning those conversations into an action plan can be difficult. Conversations can seem long, without an end goal in sight, and sometimes we have nothing on the agenda at all. I believe that we need to change that. The current constitution is very outdated, and even has typos. As outgoing AAS President Sirus Wheaton ’23 said in his “State of the College” address, “this [current] senate has created precedent for the unprecedented.” If we want every Amherst senate after us to function effectively and serve the campus community as best they can, we need to rethink how we “do” the senate.
I have many new ideas I want to bring to the AAS. In our first few sessions, I plan to propose to the senate a slew of different initiatives, and implement the structure to execute them. At the core of these goals, I want the senate to discuss, establish, and enshrine new debate rules to facilitate better discussion. We need to make sure that every senator has the opportunity to speak their truth in our meetings, and ensure that division is not sown through those debates and discussions. As the agenda-setter for our meetings, I plan to have fun, but keep a tight schedule and make sure that we are diligent in our discussions. I will also consider using the constitutional powers of the vice president to appoint a parliamentarian — someone well versed in Robert’s Rules of Order who will help me understand how we can establish these debate rules. It will also be easier to have more structured discussions if we have a clearly outlined goal for every senate meeting. Rather than play telephone with different administration departments, I plan to discuss with the senate a “master list” of initiatives, and present it to President Michael Elliott and Dean of Students Angie Tissi-Gassoway at the beginning of the year so that we know which goals are actually attainable.
I also plan to utilize committees more effectively. One way to do this is to have committees review certain ideas and topics and then present them to the senate. If we trust senators to serve faithfully on their committees, we should have them do the work.
Currently, I am also working with another senator on new anti-racism training for the student body, and new training for Registered Student Organizations (RSO) on how to interact with the Budgetary Committee. As I have already discussed with students and senate members alike, we need a change in the way our campus community interacts with one another and the AAS. . We can and should capitalize on the strides the AAS has already been making strides to better its relationship with the student body.
As the vice president of the senate, I promise that although I will play a more “behind the scenes” role, I will do everything that I can to rewrite the reputation of the senate, from within the senate. When former Vice President Jaden Richards ’25 left the senate, citing tension with other e-board members, he warned senators that the dysfunction of the senate only works in the interest of the college’s administration, not the student body. He was right. If we are not fully functional, we let go of a critical “check” on the power of the administration. While I have an extremely productive working relationship with President Elliott and Dean Tissi-Gassoway, it is important for everyone to know that I work for all of you. I will always prioritize the students on this campus. I am currently in the early stages of developing new, fun community engagement activities across the campus to increase engagement among students. I also plan to work with other members of the e-board and senate to find a way to poll the student body for their ideas. As long as I am a student of Amherst College, every one of you can find an ally in me. That is my promise.
I am very excited to go forward and see what next year has in store for all of us. We need civic engagement, more community, less division, and more damn fun. We have the resources, we have the drive, and we have the power, together. As next year comes around, I will be making myself more available. This is also a learning experience for me, so I will be taking the rest of this semester to learn the ropes of how to be a fully-functional VP, but I am here for everyone. Come next year, I plan to have my own office hours, and send out bi-weekly updates to the student body.
Lastly, I want to congratulate the other members of our newly elected e-board, beginning with our president-elect, Lori Alarcon ’24. Lori and I both share a love of public service and giving back to the communities that give to us, so I am very excited to be vice president under her leadership. I want to congratulate Min Ji Kim ’25 on her win as treasurer. I have been working with Min Ji on the Budgetary Committee the past two semesters, and I know she will be a bold and compassionate leader. Last but not least, I want to congratulate my fellow class of 2026 members, Hedley Lawrence-Apfelbaum ’26 and Jaimie Han ’26, on their successful bids for secretary and Judiciary Council chair, respectively. I know they are just as eager to get to work as I am.
I hope everyone enjoys the rest of their semester. Soak in the beautiful weather, do something adventurous, go out with your friends, and breathe it all in. We are fortunate to be here, at this place that many of us call our second home, and we will make it better, together."
2023-04-20,On Becoming a Badminton Badass: Insider Tips from a Former Player,"
I started playing badminton in my first year of elementary school. On weekends, my grandpa would take me to the city’s youth center to practice badminton with a coach and other budding learners. From then on, my decade-long love for this unofficially-Asian sport began, and I practiced and played whenever the time allowed.
Looking back, I am immensely proud of the student-athlete life that my younger self once lived. Pursuing an extracurricular activity within an academic-driven culture was both a privilege and a litmus test of my perseverance. Thanks to my mom, who encouraged me to put physical well-being first and join badminton, I was able to navigate the demands of school and life with a clear and focused mind.
As expected, traveling to America for the remaining years of high school put a limitation on my capacity for time management. My calendar was soon chock-full with volunteer gigs, SAT and AP cramming sessions, and college application due dates. The racket that I brought over from Vietnam remained in the deepest corner of my wardrobe, and I forgot about its existence for years.
Entering Amherst, I was excited to hear about the existence of the Badminton Club. My presumption about American colleges, where people solely played tennis and golf, slowly faded away. I wrote down my name and email at the Badminton Club booth at the Get Involved Fair, harboring a hope for a soft comeback with rackets and shuttlecocks. Joining without knowing anyone on the team, it was reassuring to see students from different backgrounds have friendly interactions and plan their next practice on GroupMe.
However, I quickly realized that my workload as an Amherst student was intense and unrelenting. The task at hand was not a one-time assignment with a single deadline, but rather a project that included a sequence of deadlines. As I grinded to complete the work on time, I found myself already involved in a perpetual match of “badminton,” constantly running after the “birdie,” or deadline, always out of my reach.
Even amid such an unanticipatedly entropic school life, I still managed to hit the court with our Badminton Club once last semester. Upon arriving at the Alumni Gymnasium, I was pleased to see the careful preparation of equipment, from the setting up of nets and poles to the generous provision of rackets and cylindrical cartons of birdies. The scene immediately transported me to my old days of playing badminton, carefree and unconcerned with the outside world. The epitome of ideal college camaraderie wondrously rested on these teamwork-focused moments — when both scoring or missing a goal causes emotions to run high, hearing cheers and words of encouragement calm even the most chaotic of thoughts. At those moments, you know that is all you ever need. I felt so very lucky to have received that support from both sides of the game. The experience was indeed a much-needed refreshing break from the endless stream of schoolwork.
After the game, I was relieved to have still retained certain skills after all those years away from my racket. As much as I took delight in the play-off games, I did notice several technical concerns that I felt compelled to vocalize.
To begin with, warm-ups were completely omitted before the game. Although I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt by assuming that they did warm-up on days I wasn’t present, it was worrying to see my fellow players jump straight to the match without any stretching or warm-up exercises. In sports, pre-workout warmups are a hallmark for ensuring a safe game. Skipping warm-ups can leave players vulnerable to cramps and injuries. Years ago, I was told to complete 10 rounds around the court, followed by a series of bending and stretching exercises, which typically took me around 15 minutes.
Additionally, I spotted many players grabbing their rackets improperly. They were either holding their rackets too tightly or situating their thumbs over other fingers, which disabled the built-in functions of the rackets in many ways. In some situations, it can inflict pain on the players’ wrist, the least desired outcome anybody would want from playing sports. Back in my earlier days, I was interrupted many times during my game because my coach caught sight of me holding the racket incorrectly. To help me out, he showed me the V-grip, where the thumb and finger form a V-shaped angle, and the head of the thumb lands in the gap between the index finger and middle finger. It took me many attempts to eventually do it right, but it was definitely worth the endurance, seeing how my birdies would land beautifully on the other side of the court.
Per my next observation, players were eager to hit the target head-on. I understand the temptation — in fact, I plead guilty for being a sucker for this move. But what will you do when it comes at a much, much lower height, and you hit it directly into the net? From a strategic standpoint, it is advisable to weave a web of tactics that work in these situations, and at the same time keep the opponents on their toes by rendering the direction of the birdie more unpredictable. Additionally, many players were not following through with full swings, which was simply moving the racket past the waist after touching the birdie. Failure to execute the entire maneuver jeopardizes our control over the birdie: not only does it sway the desired direction of the birdie, but also weakens the strength of their shots.
In addition to the above, players did not serve the birdie properly. Despite the simplicity of the low serve technique, which is uncomplicated and effortless to execute, there are other serving methods that players could contemplate, such as the traditional high serve. I advocate for this serve method as it forces the opponent to go the extra mile, thus giving the player some space to calculate options for the next move. Some students were hesitant to try the high serve, which can be tricky for players who haven’t received formal training. The pressure of performing in front of others can make this tactic even more neglected. For this one to work, we need to take initiatives by asking those that are already familiar with this serve technique like the back of their hands.
Finally, I noticed that most players tended to stay in one spot during the game. Badminton is a lightning-fast sport that expects players to react quickly to the birdie. Rather than aimlessly chasing after the birdie, the art lies in the agile footwork. Try absorbing the working principle of a rubber band: stretch out your leg in rhythm with the arrival of the birdie, and snap it back as you are done responding to the birdie.
There are many other details that merit further explorations, but I have highlighted the top five elements that I believe, if given due priority correctly, can breathe new life into a badminton game.
It was heartwarming to witness people come together, bond, and enjoy themselves on the court. Nonetheless, as someone who used to play competitively, I understand that incorrect techniques can lead to serious injuries. My badminton coaches, who were competing for the national team, always emphasized the importance of getting the basics right from the beginning. Continuing with poor techniques can result in muscle strain and other injuries. I dreaded the process of slowing everything down so much, just to realize he was right all along.

In outsiders’ impressions, Amherst is portrayed as a hotbed of cutting-edge research work, but what truly sets us apart is the students’ constant strive to acquire extensive knowledge in our extracurricular activities outside academia. From photography to stand-up comedy, there’s always someone in the vicinity to consult. Concurrently, the outlook for sports is not so positive. I can’t help but feel a chasmic divide between non-athletes and student athletes on this campus. Our school recruits well-built athletes that bring back trophies from sports tournaments, and we have become too reliant on them to carry the load. As a community, we should share these responsibilities collectively, starting with sparing some gaps on our calendar to learn and appreciate the club sports that we commit to even for only 30 minutes a week. As members of the Badminton Club, we should organize how-to events where the pros can show the newbies the ropes. Sure, having a coach in this context would sound ideal, but we can always bank on YouTube walkthroughs and instruction websites.

Playing badminton with friends is an absolute blast, and my intention is by no means to downplay the accomplishments of our fellow enthusiasts. I’ll be honest: I’m far from being the best player, but knowing how these little things helped me get this far on my badminton journey, I felt an irresistible urge to speak my mind about something that has been near and dear to my heart with you all. Allow me to analogize playing badminton with a conversation. You always need two to tango, and instead of words, the means of exchange is the feathered cone. In a sense, missing out on basic steps creates the impression of dropping etiquette and manners.
I hope this reflective article introduces a viewpoint in the hypothetical roundtable discussion of how we can elevate a badminton performance. By redirecting our focus on the fundamentals, we can unlock a new level of fun and wholesomeness."
2023-04-12,The Jig Is Up: Amherst Needs To Lower Its Tuition,"
On March 7, we were informed that the college has increased comprehensive fees (including tuition, room, and board) by almost $4,000 the next year to $84,210, a 4.9 percent increase from the fees of the current year. In the past ten years, the college has, on average, increased the tuition by 4 percent each year, pacing more than twice the inflation rate. Many other elite private universities across the United States have driven their prices up by similar degrees, much higher than tuition at similarly prestigious, international institutions. I’ll point out the obvious: this is absurd. Tuition at Amherst must be lowered to help to make a liberal arts education truly accessible and desirable to all.
High tuition is often justified as a form of “rich tax” that allows the college to essentially request funds from its top 1 percenters and use it to fund financial aid and student services. As a result, tuition increases could seem trivial for financial-aid students with the same expected financial contribution, perhaps even beneficial for the student experience at Amherst.
However, we should be suspicious of the priorities that are fueling rising tuition. While tuition increases significantly outpace inflation, has student financial needs at Amherst seen significant changes in recent years? Where are the additional costs being funneled to?
I don’t have an answer, but the high-tuition phenomenon is not uncommon among American elite universities and is widely explained by the arms race of prestige pricing among elite colleges (to increase demand for an education by treating it as a luxury good) and an ever-expanding administrative apparatus. The former continues to concentrate resources and prestige to elite universities away from public universities and trade schools, while increasing demand for an elite education by treating it as a luxury good. The latter shifts American universities to look increasingly like corporations guided by market forces rather than a place of education and scholarship. With shifting focus to investment in administration and infrastructure, colleges could end up needing to divert funds (such as faculty salaries) from other areas to support the unending need to build newer makerspaces or further complicate its branching trees of administrative structure. While Amherst's specific spending breakdown is not available (in contrast to public institutions), it's plausible that Amherst shares many of these practices that continue to drive its tuition up.
At the same time, lowering tuition at Amherst can help better the American higher education landscape. By lowering tuition, Amherst can bring awareness to the problematic pricing of American universities, help halt an arms race of prestige pricing, shift the culture around college education and hiring practices, and call for more federal funding into education. From international need-blind admissions to stopping legacy admissions, Amherst is not unfamiliar with pioneering new practices in higher education to make a good liberal arts education accessible to all.
Beside the financial problems tuition costs breed, the astronomical sticker price of college impacts students’ relationship with and expectations of their education, contributing to the contraction of enrollment in humanities. Personally, I’m a greedy shopper of the course catalog — whether it be English, History, Anthropology, or Environmental Studies, many departments have a place on my saved schedules. However, as I began to seriously plan my schedule last semester, some subtle guilt always weighed my tuition against my compulsion to take more humanities courses. Just maybe, reading García Márquez or Nabokov would not be worth the Amherst price tag? I’m fully aware that a college course goes far beyond a book club, but perhaps my simplified intuitions reflect larger student anxieties about the humanities.
Historian Benjamin Schmidt claims that the plunge in humanities enrollment “seems not to reflect a sudden decline of interest in the humanities.” Instead, with job insecurity after the financial crisis and high tuition costs, students can only justify such educational expenses as financial investments, and expect matching returns from their careers.
Thus, it’s a paradox for a liberal arts college like Amherst to ask for a whopping $84,210 dollars in tuition. Amherst prides itself with a rich liberal arts tradition (opposing vocational training) and a racially and socioeconomically diverse student body. However, at the same time, students from less than upper-class backgrounds are incentivized toward spending their time in classes and internships that they believe yield more financial returns. Amherst’s open curriculum can also be further damaged as no distribution requirements exist to prevent students from swarming to more career-specific courses and specializations.
Financial aid does not seem to completely close the financial gap for many students either. Anecdotally, there are many students at Amherst and other institutions, like Zoe Callan ’25, whose financial aid packages changed during their four years and were forced to resort to student loans or transfering. Work-study requirements of financial aid packages create additional burdens for low-income students navigating through college. The uncertainty of changing financial aid packages alone can dissuade students from pursuing a private university compared to an in-state school. Meanwhile, middle-class families find themselves stuck awkwardly in the dilemma of “too rich for aid, too poor for tuition” at private universities. Many more lower-income students were turned away before the college application process even started and saw high tuitions at private universities as completely out of reach. Many private institutions attract students of lower socioeconomic status by focusing its recruitment efforts in select urban poor communities or schools, while only impressing poor rural students as highly inaccessible luxuries. The cost of high sticker-price tuition does not just dissuade students away from humanities, but also creates distressing and long-lasting impacts on the financial, social, and academic lives of many students.
But, is it possible for private universities to maintain their high-level operations while cutting student fees? St. John's College, a liberal arts college known for its Great Books curriculum, responded in the affirmative. Citing the problems of prestige pricing of elite universities, St. John's announced in 2018 that it would slash its tuition from $53,000 to $35,000, while supplementing its financial vitality using donation campaigns. A bold financial move, St. John’s has seen success from increased donations, applications, yield and general financial stability. While Amherst and many other colleges are still recovering from the pandemic, there are reasons for us to believe that lowering tuition could be feasible and beneficial for Amherst if it so willed.
At the same time, perhaps American elite universities do not need to operate the way they always operated. With impending budget cuts, Amherst administration and individual departments will have to identify waste in their spending and identify the core missions that they value and commit to funding. Just perhaps, we don't need $300 trivia prizes or pay an administrator triple the salary of a tenured professor.
Despite many efforts to aid its less privileged students, Amherst still has an imperative to investigate its increasing fees to help stymie the pricing practices and spending trends of elite universities. Amherst has this imperative, not because of a romantic imagination of its utopian liberal arts identity, but because lowering the tuition would not only make an Amherst education more accessible, but would encourage transformations in higher education beyond Amherst. Wouldn’t this be a real act of leadership that “enlightens the lands”?"
2023-04-12,When Financial Aid Fails,"
Amherst College prides itself on its progressive financial aid policies. It claims to be a loan-free school that fully meets demonstrated financial need for all students. Its website affably advertises its generous policy under “Financial Aid & Costs,” assuring prospective students that “If your family shows that it can pay only a small portion of tuition and costs — or maybe none at all — Amherst pays the rest.”
For Zoe Callan ’25, this isn’t the case.
Two years ago, she traveled across the country from her home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, excited to embark on a new adventure and explore the world. She was interested in Amherst’s study abroad programs, and knew a member of the Native and Indigenous Students Association (NISA), who urged her to enroll.
Since becoming a student, Callan has been incredibly active on campus — as a registered member of the Navajo nation, she serves on the e-board of NISA. She is a member of the Ace/Aro Grey Space and the Stage Combat Club. She’s on the e-board for Amherst Safe Space for Kinksters. She has acted in multiple Green Room shows and has held an array of different jobs on campus since her freshman fall — at the Fitness Center, the Science Center café, at Grab-n-Go, for the communications office, and for the Phonathon. She’s an English and Spanish double major and speaks fondly of classes she’s taken, such as “Emily Dickinson” with Professor of American Studies and English Karen Sanchez-Eppler. She has also taken advantage of the Center for Counseling and Mental Health. Although her Amherst experience has been stressful at times, she’s made strong connections with friends and professors and enjoyed the school’s programming and student organizations.
But Callan will have to leave campus after this semester. In just two years, she has accumulated $30,000 in student loan debt.
Callan’s situation is somewhat unique, as she entered the college as a dependent student but became an independent student after getting married in 2022. Dependent students need to report all guardians’ financial information, while independent students only report their own financial information. With the change, it would be cheaper to go to her state university in New Mexico and pay full tuition than to continue attending Amherst with her current financial aid. The initial financial aid offer she received this year was not promising, but she believed that it would improve after being reviewed in Jan. 2022, when her mother quit her job to take care of Callan’s grandmother. It didn’t. Despite all that she had done for Amherst, the college did nothing for her in return.
Callan has tried hard to stay at Amherst. She has attempted to appeal, and has met with the financial aid office several times, all with minimal success. “I have never left a meeting with financial aid without crying,” Callan told me, “I’ve heard that it’s not an uncommon experience.” The last person she spoke with seemed like he cared, she said, but didn’t actually do anything useful or helpful. She was told they would look at her application “‘with as much compassion as possible,”’ which has produced little concrete action. “At this point, I’m just so tired,” Callan said. “It’s really hard to keep trying when, after everything, it just feels hopeless.”
When asked about her plans for the future, Callan admitted that she wasn’t entirely sure. “I have applied to other institutions to transfer,” she said. “I’d love to stay here, but I just can’t do it anymore.” The process of trying to secure sufficient financial aid has been “stressful for [her], stressful for family, stressful for friends.” She says that she “can’t keep holding out hope for a miracle.”
Amherst’s need-based financial aid seems ideal on its surface. But as Callan pointed out, “The problem with need-based financial aid is that the college determines your need … They can do that in a variety of ways that don’t necessarily match what you can afford to do.” Another major pitfall of the model is that outside scholarships are calculated against determined need, so Callan cannot benefit from her veteran father’s GI Bill education benefits. Receiving outside aid would lessen the impact of her existing aid from Amherst. She implores the administration to reconsider their financial aid policy regarding outside scholarships “because it hurts so many people.”

Callan urges students to “know the policy. Don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself. Know that you’re not alone. This is an exhausting, stressful thing, and it’s OK if sometimes that’s overwhelming, and it’s also okay to go somewhere else where that’s not a problem if you need to.”

While many students can, thankfully, benefit from financial aid, there are glaring gaps for those who don’t fit the mold. Callan’s situation reflects a failure of the ostensibly need-based system that Amherst claims to offer. She has invested two years of hard work at Amherst, and for her diligence, ingenuity, and leadership, she has received tens of thousands of dollars in debt. The college must do better to accommodate Callan and all students suffering from a similar plight. Until all need is truly met, Amherst cannot call itself “loan-free.”"
2023-04-12,"Repurposing Space, Preserving Place","
There is much to be excited about when it comes to the new Student Center and Dining Commons — the joint project that will extensively repurpose the existing structure of the currently deserted Merrill Science Building. Designed by Swiss architectural firm Herzog and de Meuron, the center’s spaces will be built under four guiding principles: well-being (exercise areas, prayer rooms, and party venues), engagement (homes for various student organizations), gathering (lounges and event spaces), and creating (makerspaces, performance areas, and an indoor greenhouse). Advertised as a bridge between upper and lower campus, the Center is intended to be a crossroads of interests and affinities.
But there is also reason for trepidation about the project’s potential impact on campus life. When the center “replace[s] the dining facility located in the aging Valentine Hall, which is nearing the end of its useful life,” the dynamic of campus will radically change. Val has long been the nucleus around which Amherst orbits. As our only dining hall, it draws just about every student on campus (excluding residents of the Humphries House food co-op) at least once a day. Many students plan their housing selections around proximity to Val, with some even living in Val’s residential second level. Val also serves as a social hub, a place for students living on opposite sides of campus to meet up, bump into one another, or spend many consecutive hours studying at a table as part of a practice known as “Val-sitting.”
The construction of the center will lead to a drastic reorientation of campus space, as student life will begin to revolve around an entirely difficult focal point: one that is (at Merrill’s current site) much further south. It should be noted that this shift could isolate those who live in dorms on the north and west parts of campus: Residents of the Triangle or the Hill, for instance, will be situated even further from the center of campus life than they already are.
A new use for the first floor of Val has not yet been decided. With the new center on the horizon, it’s important to consider ways in which Val can best be repurposed to avoid creating an unbalanced campus.
If Val were to be kept as a second dining hall, there could be shorter lines, more culinary options, and Grab-n-Go for dinner. However, it’s preferable that Val does not remain as a second dining hall. Such a purpose may reinforce a bifurcated STEM-humanities campus — an extension of the existing Science Center/Frost Library study space dichotomy — as busy students will naturally gravitate towards the more convenient dining hall located closest to where they spend their time. This speculation reaffirms how college’s notorious “fishbowl effect” is in fact valuable: Unlike larger schools in which divisions are necessary for the sake of organization, Amherst can share a communal space in which students are exposed to others pursuing different academic and extracurricular endeavors instead of being segregated by interest. Thus, although Amherst should remain a single-dining-hall campus, the Editorial Board proposes that Val be fashioned into a new student space to counterbalance the social shift towards Merrill.
With a location for social gathering as a broad umbrella, Val becomes a space open to possibilities. At the very least, it should continue to function as a dorm as the college continues to overenroll amid a long-existing housing crisis. Val could transform into a cafe setting or a late night hangout location, comparable to the role of Schwemm’s pre-Covid. It should be noted that according to findings from the recent sexual assault prevention talk, researchers recommend that colleges add such public spaces to congregate. Ingredients could be stocked in its kitchen for students to practice self-sufficient cooking skills. It could possibly even serve as student storage, eliminating the need to pay for Boomerang. In any case, student opinion should lead the way.
Though the Editorial Board believes that Val would be best furnished as a multipurpose common space, the more urgent issue is bringing this impending shift in student life into campus consciousness. As the administration is still deliberating on what to make of our beloved Val, the student body must voice their opinions on this drastic modification to their campus life. After all, as a strong sense of place is integral to the Amherst experience, it stands to reason that we must consider with sensitivity the changes made to our shared space."
2023-04-05,Tapti Talks: Living with Chronic Illness,"
I started Tapti Talks as a way to discuss some of the less romantic realities of student life — and today I’d like to shed some light on my experience as a chronically ill student at Amherst.
I’m technically writing this article with a concussion, which I received last Tuesday when I passed out in my room and hit my head on the floor, after an hour of seeing black spots in my vision. For a lot of people, this would be a freak occurrence, an unfortunate incident that stemmed from some sort of unhealthy habit or a sudden illness. For me, though, this is all-too-common.
I was 14 when I was diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or POTS. The diagnosis came as a relief after a childhood of being considered a “দুর্বল” (weak or sickly) child in Bangladesh. My parents have always joked that if someone coughs within 100 meters of me, I will get sick; I am so susceptible to the fevers and illnesses that somehow manage to escape most of my peers. When I started passing out or complaining of constant lightheadedness, it was just attributed to my frailty — “some children are just born weaker than others,” the doctors would tell my mom.
With the diagnosis came a myriad of changes: higher salt and water intake, new meds with the incredibly fun side effect of a compromised immune system, and the knowledge that fainting was now a semi-regular part of my life. Even with my POTS, however, I tried to live as normally as possible.
POTS only became as big a part of my life as it is now after I got Covid-19. At Amherst, we’ve had a lot of controversy surrounding masking debates and reasons to or not to mask, often talking about immunocompromised and chronically ill people in the abstract. Well, my experience with Covid-19 a showcase of its detrimental effects. In the immediate aftermath of having Covid-19, my POTS worsened drastically, to the point where I was going to my classes lightheaded and fatigued out of my mind. There were multiple instances where I would quite literally be unable to walk, feeling pain course through my body and having to ask my friends for help getting to Val or Frost so I could get even a little bit of work done. While I have steadily improved again since then, my condition still hasn’t returned to its pre-Covid-19 level.
Every cardiologist I’ve seen, both here and back home, said there was nothing they could do for me, citing statistics of poor prospects for POTS patients post-Covid-19. “How can I prevent my blood pressure from suddenly dropping below 80/60?” I would ask. “Eat salt and lie down so you don’t hit your head when you faint,” they would tell me.
This past year, I’ve really had a reckoning with what it means to be “disabled.” Walking up hills to my classes, I am forced to stop as I feel my heart twinge painfully, and I inevitably arrive late (there’s a conversation to be had about how inaccessible Amherst’s campus topography is). I am unable to leave bed sometimes, feeling too weak to even lift my limbs to email my professors. I find my hands freezing up and turning numb and blue in the middle of typing an essay, and I am forced to run them under hot water until I can use them again. My email’s “sent” folder is a litany of “I’m sorrys.” 
Living with chronic illnesses is a constant set of compromises with yourself. I try to do work in advance, because I know I will inevitably fall behind when my flare ups take place. If I go to the gym, I cannot do anything strenuous for the rest of the day or else I will feel ill afterwards. Anything involving heavy activity — hiking, rafting, climbing — is either near impossible or extremely difficult for me to do. I have an internal debate about whether to go to every social gathering I’m invited to, knowing there’s a chance I’ll be infected — if not with Covid-19, then the common cold which for some reason gives me a 102-degree fever.
I’m still learning how to take care of myself and be mindful of my illness, and I’m sure many of my peers who are chronically ill can relate. If there’s any piece of advice I would give to my past-self though, it would be to give myself grace for the times I’m not feeling so great; and on the other side of things, to take advantage of the good days, whether it means catching up on work, hanging out with friends, or doing something outdoors. I find that I’m happiest when I feel like I’m able to do all the things everyone else does.
My POTS isn’t going away any time soon, and there’s not much to do about it but make the most of each day as best I can. I’m hopeful, and I have so much to be thankful for. My positivity isn’t false at all because I know my illness doesn’t define my identity. I have been so lucky to have professors that are incredibly understanding and supportive when I’m not at my best self. To my professors, if you’re reading this, thank you so much. And to my lovely, lovely friends and family, who have called and texted and walked me back from class and fed me salt packets and knitted me fingerless gloves to keep my hands warm, there’s nothing I could really say to encapsulate my gratitude more than: <3"
2023-04-05,"Turtles, Eggs, and Rocks: Vietnamese Superstitions in Practice","
If you are burdened with seemingly unsolvable problems, talk it out with your Vietnamese friend. One thing that is characteristic of Vietnamese culture is how persevering people are in looking for solutions, even if that means trying out obscure methods. The saying “You miss a hundred percent of the shots you don’t take” rings true when describing the people’s meticulous search for solutions.

These resolutions are driven by folktales and traditional practices. As a child of Vietnam, I am compiling 12 superstitions — including folk remedies and taboos — that are most often used by my family and friends. They might just help you out.

Take a Rain Check During the Ghost Month
While Vietnamese people do business using a solar calendar, they make sure to double-check with the lunar calendar (check out this site’s conversion tables). In this calendar preserved for the Underworld, July is named a Ghost Month, which is the time Hell’s Gate opens and releases damned souls into the living world. With devilish powers meddling with people’s affairs, important events like moving houses, buying cars, and going on business trips must wait. If you insist on proceeding with your plan, chances are you’ll experience a real-life League of Legends Player Kill match with an opponent that you can’t see with naked eyes.

Heal Hiccups with Hydration
To stop hiccups, people suggest violent methods like scaring the crap out of hiccup-ers, or having them stop breathing for a short period. But a proposition from Vietnamese predecessors is to solve it one sip at a time — take seven sips of water if you are a male, and nine sips if you are a female. This stems from a Daoist mythological belief about the duality of souls that deems that, apart from having the same three cloud-souls (hún 魂 in Chinese; they represent the personality and consciousness), men each have seven white-souls, and women have nine. A white-soul — in Chinese, pò 魄 — refers to the subconscious side of the being, which dictates the thought-free process, such as the growth and healing of the body.
Despite being known as a folk remedy for hiccups, this one is well substantiated with actual scientific evidence. When drinking water continuously with many distinct small sips, the diaphragm will no longer spasm. In addition, if you drink water continuously while holding your breath, the concentration of blood’s carbon dioxide increases. As a result, hiccups are repelled faster.
In my experience, if you do it right, it is a foolproof formula when hiccups make a random visit.

Let Go of Broken Mirrors
For “Constantine” die-hards, mirrors are easily recognized as being among the special gateways that connect two words.
When demons look into the mirror, they see their fierce form in the mirror and run away in fear. When the mirror is broken, it is a sign that the devil has been set free from the exorcism, thereby being empowered to spread negative energies.

Drive Away Ghosts with the Om Mani Padme Hum Chant
To Buddhist practitioners, this “spell” is beyond a cultural superstition and contains the charisma to drive away the evil forces and fill life with delight. Originated in Sanskrit, Om Mani Padme Hum, translated to “Praise to the Jewel in the Lotus,” is crowned the longest mantra in existence. There’s not one but numerous variations surrounding the explanation of this chant whose meaning cost Buddha 1000 lives to find. No matter how different these interpretations are, they all point to the omnipresence of Avalokiteshvara, the most important deity in Buddhism. So, in reciting the chant with sincere devotion, one is calling the compassionate heart of the deity to their life.
The chant is well-received in many countries where Buddhism is prevalent. In an exclusive interview with the New York Times in 2022, Everything Everywhere All At Once superstar Michelle Yeoh shared her habit of reciting the chant as a crucial step of her daily fitness routine.
During last summer’s dorm transition period, I was making long walks from Val Quad to the Zu almost every night. Under the moon, citing the chant verbatim gave me full-fledged courage to make it home.

Cutting Hair on Certain Days
When they face difficulties in life or are experiencing a depressed mood, Vietnamese people often cut their hair. The haircut is considered a lucky charm, helping to expel bad luck, change appearance, and bring good luck to one’s life. But if all is well, a haircut will reverse that.
At the same time, many believe that hair is like the antenna of the brain. Cutting hair before an exam will force the learned knowledge to fall out of one’s brain, causing you to fail the exam, perhaps, or incur bad luck.

Eating Before Exams
Regarding what to eat (and not to eat) on testing day, Vietnamese students have quite a list. Stay away from all types of eggs. Possessing a round shape, eggs look like a zero, which is not something one hopes to receive as a grade. No bananas should be consumed either, for their slippery nature can cause facts to slip your mind and lead you to flop an exam. Instead, try to eat more red beans. In Vietnamese, “beans” is a homonym with the word “passing,” which is highly anticipated good news for exam takers. Like many already know, red is a lucky color, so in combination, red beans are an ideal consumption choice for earning flying colors. On the other hand, black beans are out of people’s favor. Black represents bad luck, so black beans can indicate a bad omen for your next exam.

Don’t Gift Your Lover(s) Shoes or Handkerchiefs
Couples, take note. While giving shoes as a gift can be seen as an affectionate act, it is also believed that new shoes bring the recipients to new land, thus signifying an eventual end to the relationship. Similarly, according to feng shui, handkerchiefs as gifts can also be a bad choice for relationships, because they are used to wipe tears and sweat, thus symbolizing sadness and misery. Giving handkerchiefs to each other predicts separation.

No Pet Turtles
Turtles have always played an important role in beliefs and feng shui. Along with dragons, unicorns, and phoenixes, turtles are one of the four spirits that guard the four corners of the Earth. Yet, they are the only one existent while the three others are only seen in illustrated works. Then, how come raising them is a bad idea? The Five Phases theory establishes that turtles are associated with the fire element. Also in this theory, relationships among five elements are explained with multiple cycles. As fire produces earth in the inter-promoting cycle, people identified with the earth element are said to be suited for raising turtles. However, fire melts metal in the inter-regulating cycle, so people with metal as their element are advised to not keep turtles because it can adversely affect the fortune of the owner.
In reality, though, no matter what element they are, if one of my friends brings home a turtle, they will be scolded so badly for potentially slowing the family’s progress. Turtles are mostly seen in public places, namely temples and lakes. Vietnamese people believe that turtles being outside, unleashed, activates their strongest power, thereby benefiting the entire community. Hanoi’s Hoan Kiem Lake is a historical site that bears proof to Vietnamese favor of turtles.

Skip Rocks on the Way Home
In the past, unidentified dead bodies, or those without relatives, were often buried on the roadside or along the river. People used rocks as blessings when burying the dead. Therefore, the ordinary-looking stone you see on the roadside may be the same stone that was used for such a purpose, and it can carry the soul of the dead person back home with whoever is picking it up. At many rock-filled Vietnamese tourist sites, visitors are told real stories of people encountering strange phenomena after bringing home some colorful rocks. This actually helps people leave things where they belong.

Involve Little Ones in Your House-Hunting Journey
Our grandparents always note that, when moving to a new house, especially an old house bought from someone else, you should bring a dog or baby under three years old. When you go to a house and the dog walks around the house wagging its tail or the baby crawls and plays by himself, this shows that it is a good place. Conversely, when the dog doesn’t want to come in and barks constantly, or the baby cries, this place has negative energy. Naturally, babies and dogs are thought to be able to recognize an invisible force existing in the house.

Avoid Jingling Your Keys After Dark
After 10 p.m., it is absolutely advised that you do not shake your house keys. Ghosts are sensitive to sounds, and shaking keys can be a surefire way to invite the wandering spirits into your home. At night, it’s best to leave your keys somewhere they won’t make any sound. Similarly, refrain from doing the dishes at this hour as the clashing sounds from this activity are inviting as well.

Comb Your Hair Before Getting into Vehicles
From ancient times, it was believed that the mirror and comb are the objects that create the connection between the two realms of yin and yang. In rituals for kids that die young, mirrors and combs are mostly seen items.
Older people believe that homeless souls often wander on the street to find shelter, and once a strand of hair falls out due to our physical force, the yang qi (positive energy) in the hair exudes, the yin qi (negative power) becomes stronger, creating favorable conditions for these souls to intrude and create disturbance.
Hence, drivers are afraid that passengers checking themselves in the mirror or brushing their hair in the car can accidentally “wake up” those unjustly dead souls, allowing them to enter through the mirror or the comb to curse the entire car and people within it.
Try to do your hair before boarding, but if it can’t be done in advance, save your grooming for later.

Conclusion: What Do We Make of This?
Following these superstitious beliefs is not purely a ritual in Vietnamese culture. It is a means of honoring our cultural legacy — the beliefs our ancestors relied on to benefit future generations — in our daily routines. While having so many options can be overwhelming, these little things are a helpful guide to our daily actions.
Accompanying them is a popular Vietnamese saying that translates to “With prayer, there is holiness; with forbearance, there is good.”
My aunt told me that when there’s a fire in front of us, being blind doesn’t give us special treatment of not getting burnt by it. “It feels helpless to not know how the universe actually works, so knowing possible ways is a privilege.”
It can be hard to relate to these quirky beliefs, especially when you didn’t grow up in that culture. However, when unexpected life scenarios happen to drive you to insanity, remember, you are provided with a rare opportunity to put these Vietnamese-style hacks into testing. Who knows, maybe you’ll stave off some bad luck!"
2023-03-29,Strict Attendance Policies Do More Harm Than Good,"
There are a number of professors at Amherst who will dock your grade proportionally to the number of class meetings you miss: be absent twice, and your A becomes an A-; miss class three times, and you’re brought down a whole letter grade. The harm these policies cause disadvantaged students — often forcing them to make the impossible decision between academic success and their own wellbeing — cannot be understated, and faculty must recognize that their strict attendance policies are inequitable. It is time we do away with them in pursuit of a more just and equitable curriculum.
Professors often base these policies on an idealized notion of the college experience: the idea that we students are here, first and foremost, for academics — and, to their credit, many of us are. A large portion of Amherst students come to campus with the economic privilege to be able to solely focus on their schoolwork. They’re motivated, excellent, and relatively unobstructed in their intellectual pursuits. The problem, however, begins when this isn’t the case.
These policies harm the students who don’t have the privilege of engaging in academic life without external constraints: namely, first generation low-income (FLI) students, students with mental illnesses, students with disabilities, and students with other severe health conditions. It is important to note here that these students are still motivated, excellent, and worthy. However, through no fault of their own, they are unable to put as much time and focused energy into academic life as their peers. Strict attendance policies only harm them — as they are made to choose between their grades and their own well-being.
These policies sometimes force FLI students into a predicament in which they have to choose between financial security and academic success. Additionally, students with pressing health concerns are made to sacrifice their wellbeing for the same reason. In both cases, students are prompted to make an impossible choice between caring for themselves and succeeding academically. The undue stress this imposes on disadvantaged students increases inequity, harming the very students the college should be seeking to support the most.
Some faculty might argue that these attendance policies serve an important pedagogical purpose: strengthening class participation. It should be acknowledged, however, that participation grades are much better at achieving this end, as they take into account meaningful contributions to classroom discussions, rather than only the fact of attendance in and of itself. Doubly so, they still incentivize students to show up to class.
While an accommodation does exist for students who need flexibility with attendance, this measure alone does not do enough to support all students who are disadvantaged. Students who are undiagnosed — sometimes due to socioeconomic barriers — while still suffering from severe conditions, are in no way able to be accommodated. This not only poses a threat to their academic success, but to their entire wellbeing, as students are then made to sacrifice their health for their grades. For this group of students, it is then left entirely to the discretion of the professors whether or not their absences should be excused — this gives too much power to individual faculty members, and leaving open the possibility for less understanding professors to penalize them for prioritizing their needs.
Lastly, the faculty’s argument itself belies a contradiction. Even if we were to concede to professors that a sizable portion of students are excellent, motivated, and unobstructed in their academic pursuits — which is undeniably true — we would still run into a problem: for if students here are as excellent and unimpeded as professors seem to believe, they would show up to class anyway. The strict attendance policies would then only serve as an empty formality — one that only ends up hurting students without the luxury of engaging with academic life in an unobstructed manner.
One might argue that doing away with strict attendance policies opens a loophole for unmotivated students to exploit, as they’ll no longer be penalized for their absences. It should be noted, first and foremost, that this reason alone is not a strong enough justification for these policies: progressive changes should not be discounted merely because of the potential presence of a few bad actors. Instead, other, less inequitable policies should be put in place to counteract them — and participation grades serve that very purpose. These grades incentivize students who otherwise may not show up to class to do so, and, moreover, to meaningfully contribute to class discussions. The bottom line is that participation grades do everything these inequitable attendance policies do, and better.
It must be said that many students do not go to college in a vacuum, and it’s time all faculty members come to recognize that fact. The idyllic vision these professors have of an undergraduate experience insulated from intruding obstacles or obligations hurts the students for whom this isn’t the case. This tension between the ideal and the reality of life on a diverse campus is manifest in their strict attendance policies. It’s high time faculty members put an end to these harmful restrictions in pursuit of a more just and equitable curriculum."
2023-03-29,Defamiliarizing Discourse,"
Between the Point/Counterpoint series, LitFest, the Presidential Scholars Program, and innumerable weekly events, Amherst students have access to a wealth of visiting speakers on campus. Indeed, it feels as though one can’t go a week without being bombarded by fliers in a GroupMe chat or Valentine Dining Hall for at least one talk, often by impressively big names in government and academia.
Though we are extremely privileged as an institution to be able to bring these outside perspectives to our campus on such a regular basis, the Editorial Board feels that we need greater diversity in the types of speakers we bring onto this campus. The vast majority of speakers the administration brings are figureheads whose talks often feel surface-level or highly predictable, and allow little room for students to critically discuss or debate with the speakers. Beyond our typical candidate pool — which mainly encompasses Capitol Hill Democrats and professors from peer institutions — there are guests who could turn the worn-out speaker format into a truly provocative and stimulating event on campus.
This reflection is crucial in the context of impending school-wide budget cuts, which will likely limit the number of speaker opportunities in the next academic year. Now, we need to seriously think about the sorts of speakers and outside perspectives we want to bring to our campus, and how we want to engage in dialogue with those speakers when they do come.
While there's some truth in the claim that the lack of speaker diversity reflects Amherst’s strictly progressive politics, there are plenty of differing opinions about issues within our majority left-leaning campus: last year’s Point/Counterpoint debate between Kwame Anthony Appiah and Adolph Reed Jr. over the extent to which race can be reduced to a function of class is a stellar example. Amherst could do more to highlight these points of friction among left-leaning intellectuals. Furthermore, although political diversity is important, speakers do not have to always be brought in to discuss important societal and global issues. We can just as easily bring in more light-hearted speakers who would rather discuss, say, the philosophy of love and marriage.
That being said, there is absolutely space to bring in speakers who do not share progressive viewpoints. The question that arises here, however, is how we as a student body should engage with those speakers, and where and how we should draw the line between violent and merely oppositional speech.
Stanford Law School made headlines nationwide last week after students protested and shouted down a conservative judge brought onto campus by a student group. A school official criticized the student body and apologized to the speaker for the students’ betrayal of his right to free speech, while many students argued that they had a right to protect their campus from the presence of a judge whose past court decisions have limited the rights of women, immigrants, and LGBTQ individuals.
Before we invite any speaker to campus, controversial or not, there are several questions we should ask of the process. What constitutes hate speech from a speaker? How much should a speaker’s past history factor into their present role as speaker? Should students be allowed to protest speakers or even shut down events that they believe will have a harmful impact on our community? What is the goal of our bringing a speaker in the first place — to endorse their beliefs or generate dialogue?
These are not questions the Editorial Board can or should answer alone. Instead, we call for the student body to reflect on our values as a campus community, and consider how we can implement more diverse voices while preventing real harm to members of our community. Certain formats that are not widely used, currently, may be more conducive to productive engagement with ideologically-challenging speakers: organizing for a debate between a conservative and liberal speaker, for instance, is better than letting the former take the podium unquestioned. Or, we as a student body need to commit ourselves to challenging speakers — something that is currently disappointingly far from the norm. After all, when we bring a speaker onto this campus, we don’t just give them a platform to speak: we bring them into our universe of discourse.
Unsigned editorials represent the views of the majority of the Editorial Board — (assenting: 11; dissenting: 0; abstaining: 1)."
2023-03-29,Rant vs. Rave: Walking Around Campus,"
Liam’s Rave
In some sense, it comes as no surprise that Amherst students tend to be fast walkers. After all, what got us here other than our ability to strive forward, rushing fearlessly toward whatever sits on the horizon? Hustle culture can be shockingly literal.
But it can also be disruptive. Especially if you’re standing on the First Year Quad enjoying the first true day of a spring — balmy, sunny, a cool breeze — and gazing listlessly at the distant Holyoke Range, reflecting on all the beauty the natural world has to offer. Then, suddenly, the clock strikes 11:20, and like the world’s most frantic flash mob, a flood of students envelopes you, perhaps casting a snide head-shake as they pass: Almost all are moving at the speed of a neighborhood Honda — or the typical Queens resident — and you’re slowing them down.
If you’re a part of this mob, I have a modest request: Take a minute. Appreciate your surroundings. Commit the outline of the mountains to memory, preserve a picture of a rose blossom. Walk, don’t run (or speed-walk), to your next class.
Yasmin’s Rant
We have a problem on campus. It’s spatial awareness. Too often I am stuck in Val behind a group of people ambling, directionless, while I wait behind them, plate-in-hand, desperately wishing that they would hear me saying “excuse me.” Other times, I am forced to awkwardly overtake a fellow pedestrian looking at their phone or listening to music, looking dazed.
I recognize that I likely have a bias toward fast walking thanks to my New York City upbringing, which is a stark contrast to Liam’s Austin, Texas roots. Although I tend to partake in the 11:20 mobs that Liam describes, I am also a fan of slowing down. When I do that, however, I make sure to make space for those who are less blessed with free time.
I would like to make the case for being aware of your surroundings, and understanding that although you may be happy on your leisurely stroll or talking to several of your friends on a narrow path, there may be other people who are deathly late to something struggling to get past you. Make some room, and let them pass. I’m all for taking time to enjoy life and meander, just as long as it’s not getting in the way of other people."
2023-03-22,A Humanities Haven?,"
“The humanities are in crisis.” It’s a popular sentiment in academic circles and for good reason: Nationwide, the number of humanities majors is trending downward and departments are shrinking. In recent issues of The Student, students in the Arts and Humanities in Action (AHA) Program have reflected on the valuable skills one develops with a humanities degree, as a way to push back against this crisis. But as an elite liberal arts institution that prides itself on exploration and interdisciplinary education, where can Amherst sit?
Growing economic uncertainty and rising unemployment rates have pushed students toward disciplines like STEM and Economics to ensure financial stability. A culture of hyperproductivity, on top of these anxieties, has forced us to instrumentalize college degrees for career preparation rather than education. These all contribute to the contraction of public support for and participation in humanities disciplines: In fiscal year 2022, the National Endowment for the Humanities had a budget of $180 million, 2 percent of the National Science Foundation’s $8.84 billion budget.
Foundational to a liberal arts education is a belief that humanities disciplines are important — that the study of human society and experience has both personal and societal value. Amherst students undeniably recognize this value: even in the midst of this crisis, around 30 percent of the class of 2022 graduated with a humanities degree. Thanks to Amherst’s financial resources, certain institutional supports for the humanities have persisted amid government defunding: Resources like the Center for Humanistic Inquiry, events such as LitFest, and programs like Schupf and the Mellon Mays render Amherst students undeniably privileged in terms of access to the humanities. The crisis of the humanities, at Amherst, is not merely a microcosm of national trends.
Amherst seeks to provide a liberal arts education to a diverse student body, but enrollees are confronted by a landscape that contradicts this mission. The systemic inequality of the U.S. job market makes humanities studies and careers increasingly unobtainable for low-income, BIPOC, first-generation, and international students, all of whom occupy a relatively precarious position in the market and are incentivized to seek more secure careers. Humanities majors at Amherst should not be surprised by this reality, given the makeup of their classes.
While humanities professors acknowledge the scarcity of tenure-track positions in academia, there’s lack of support for humanities students seeking non-academic career paths. There is a much more clear understanding among STEM majors about what careers are available to them and how their skills could be applied in the workplace. Of course, a case can be made that society at large needs to change: the public must value skills from humanistic disciplines more, and the purpose of college should be reconceptualized. The explorative approach of liberal arts at Amherst can still make certain adaptations to stop declining enrollment in humanities departments. The AHA program is a laudable start, but the crisis of humanities at Amherst is about much more than a gap in understanding.
The availability of funding also limits the support that humanities students are able to receive at Amherst, since student research opportunities depend entirely on donor and department funding. The lack of funding for the humanities can be clearly seen when comparing summer research opportunities in the two disciplines. While STEM fields several different opportunities with faculty guidance, the only humanities-specific program, the Schupf Fellowship, enrolls 20 students yearly, and receives less faculty support. While some of these aspects are inherent in the differences between the fields — STEM professors can need more research assistance than their humanities counterparts — the funding gap widens the inequity.
Funding new professorships and staff creates more student research opportunities, allows for more community-building within departments, and attracts higher class enrollment. Funding infrastructure can move humanities department out of sparse locations on campus and provide them with more public space. Additionally, humanities departments across academia, including Amherst’s, can be very insular and disconnected from everyday realities. Departments can emerge from this cave by shifting their hiring practices. An emphasis on public scholarship and outreach will increase public engagement while allowing humanities students to see their study as a enrichment of how they live their lives, rather than an alienating pursuit. Amherst has the unique platform as an elite liberal arts institution to promote this shift.
As the crisis becomes more visible, it’s time to ask ourselves: how do we protect the value of humanities at Amherst? As a well-endowed haven for the liberal arts, Amherst is perhaps among the last institutions that prioritizes the humanities in a shifting landscape of higher education. Even so, Amherst’s uniquely diverse student body and funding inequities mean that, apart from a privileged few, humanities students are being abandoned on a campus filled with glittering reminders of the humanities’ value — a value that is frustratingly out of reach.

2023-03-22,Tapti Talks: Name Pronunciation Matters,"
If I had a dollar for every time someone mispronounced my name, I’d be able to pay Amherst’s tuition 10 times over. The image above showcases just one of my many ways people at Amherst have misspelled my name, in emails where my name is clearly visible. And honestly, I’ve grown tired of it.
My name is Tapti. T-a-p-t-i, pronounced “T-ah-p-tee.” It feels, to me at least, like a relatively easy “foreign” name to pronounce: It’s short, it relates relatively well phonetically to English, and in terms of pronunciation, what you see is pretty much what you get.
Yet somehow, pronouncing my name correctly seems to be an insurmountable obstacle to so many people. I’ve been in classes where the professor has continually forgotten my name until almost two months into the semester. Other times, I’ve had to spell out my name three, four, five times until my conversation partner gets it right. And all too many times, I’ve told someone my name, and they confidently pronounce it completely differently.
This is especially exasperating because, quite frankly, it feels as though I’ve already sacrificed a part of my name to assimilate into white culture. Bangla has four “T” sounds, none of which are the same as the English “T,” and my name, written as তাপ্তী in Bangla, uses a soft “T” sound — I would describe it somewhere between the “D” sound and “T” sound in English. According to the IPA, it can be approximated by pronouncing the word “get” with your tongue on your front two teeth.
When I first came to the U.S., I was determined to pronounce my name the Bengali way, to not sacrifice my cultural identity in this foreign land. That dream died the first day I told someone my name at a coffee store and watched them write down “Dabti” on my cup. I realized that I had to pronounce my name “the American way” in order for people to even get close to a resemblance of the actual word, and resigned myself to that fact. I accepted the pronunciation variations that came with it: people saying “Tapti” as in in the phrase “tap water” or “Topti” or even “Tap-tie” (the last one was a bit too egregious, even for me).
All of this is just to say, it feels like I have already sacrificed so much of myself in the Americanized way I’ve learned to pronounce my name for English speakers. Your name is an undeniably major facet of your cultural identity, and my name, in particular, means a lot to me: I was named for my deceased aunt, whose name, Tapati meant “daughter of the sun” in Bangla. In the Indian subcontinent, names can allow you to pinpoint exactly where a person’s from — my name, for instance, is specifically a Bengali Hindu name, because my parents prioritized giving me a Bengali name rather than some “generally South Asian” one.
To have people mispell and mispronounce my name even after assimilating is a slap in the face: It feels deeply dehumanizing. Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who has an East Coast American accent — I can’t even imagine how much more intense the struggle must be for my fellow international students who don’t.
Why is it that white people can say names like Dostoyevsky and Tchaikovsky, but Tapti trips them up? Put simply, it’s racism. And I’m not saying that the mistake itself is racist — obviously, until you hear me pronounce my name, you won’t know how to pronounce it. But if I’ve told you my name, pronounced, “T-ah-p-tee” (“a” pronounced as in father) and you repeat back to me, “T-​​æ-p-tee” (“æ” like the “a” in “cat”), it shows me that you don’t care about how I pronounce my name. Same goes for misspellings in emails, which feel particularly egregious considering that my name is right there at the top of the screen in my email address.
Many POC and immigrants can understand the struggle of feeling disempowered to speak up and correct people. This is especially true when it comes to professors, even knowing that you wouldn’t actually face academic consequences. As a result, your very name becomes a concession to whiteness.
I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by friends and mentors who have encouraged my urge to correct people when they mispronounced my name — to ignore the burning internal embarrassment I felt when my teacher apologized for pronouncing my name, as if it were my fault for making a mountain out of a molehill. Before coming to Amherst, I convinced myself that I would maintain this habit of firmly correcting people when they mispronounced my name.
To tell you the truth, I haven’t. I still laugh off mispronunciations, brush off people’s apologies — at every moment, it just feels easier than making a scene. I’m trying to work on it though — because how will people actually learn to be better, unless you hold them accountable? One way I try to justify it to myself is to remember that every time I correct someone, it encourages them to think twice and ask before pronouncing a future name.
In a sense, I’m writing this article as a promise to myself — to stop brushing off these microaggressions and advocate for myself. And to my fellow students with foreign, unpronounceable, difficult names — I encourage you to do the same."
2023-03-22,"Chromatic Chaos: Like a Rainbow, Noises Can Be Colorful","
Ask a random group of people how they handle procrastination.
Everyone will have a different answer for dealing with distractions, but many have likely turned to the powerful help of background sounds at least once — and white noise is one of the most popular options. YouTube videos (especially those with glowing brain-related thumbnails) featuring white noise have garnered millions of views from those looking to improve their concentration while studying.
But have you ever felt that, despite working its magic on everyone else’s focusing abilities, white noise is just not meant for you? Well, the good news is that you are not the only one. In 2022, by setting two different conditions of white noise in a study involving 39 participants, University of Southern California researchers found that while white noise improved some portions — sustained attention and creativity — of cognitive performance, it failed to show any great changes in selective attention, inhibition, and working memory. The results speak to the fact that, because each and every brain has different needs, not everyone will benefit from white noise.
Yet, there’s still room for optimism. Contrary to popular belief, white noise isn’t the only kind of brain-optimizing noise. Categorized by colors, these under-the-radar noises offer many advantages.
White Noise
For starters, white noise is perhaps the most well-known “color” of noise. White noise is the sound of static you hear on a radio or TV when there’s no signal, or the humming of the AC the moment you activate it. Similar to the color white, an amalgam of pigments of all visible lights, white noise contains equal amounts of all frequencies in the audible range. This makes it a useful tool for masking other sounds, such as tinnitus or outside noise that might be keeping you awake at night.
In the study mentioned above, however, a heightened level of white noise can actually do more harm than good. For example, 65 decibels of white noise was reported to solely improve working memory and raise stress.
Pink Noise
Pink noise is similar to white noise but has a different flat spectral density: Instead of having equal energy across all frequencies, pink noise has more energy in the lower frequencies and less in the higher frequencies. This gives it a more natural, soothing sound often compared to falling rain or ocean waves. Pink noise is widely implemented in relaxation and meditation apps (one of them is Calm), as well as in sound systems for music and film. The sounds of rustling leaves or howling winds can give you an approximation. In case you need more, your heartbeat’s rhythm is actually one of the strong pink noise-producing sources. Proven to reduce brain waves and improve memory in older adults in a 2017 study, pink noise is a strong aid for sleep stability.

Brown(ian) and Red Noise
For a moment, disregard what you learn about colors: Within this auditory subject, brown and red noise are the same thing. The “brown” in brown noises does not derive from a color name but from scientist Robert Brown who created “Brownian motion” from erratic sounds. Sometimes referred to as 1/f noise, this noise is a deeper, more rumbling sound than white or pink noise. The noise has even more energy in the lower frequencies than pink noise, which gives it a bass-heavy quality. Bearing high resemblance to the mind’s resting state, listening to brown noise easily allows people to enter their relaxation zone. Brown noise is extremely helpful for your sleep and focus, and it is sometimes used in music production to create a sense of depth and warmth.
Make sure not to confuse this brown noise with another mythical brown noise (or brown note) that is believed to make listeners defecate uncontrollably.
Blue and Purple Noise
Brown and red noise may have a twin with perfectly contrasting personalities, and that is blue and purple noise. Unlike brown and red noise, blue and purple noises are two distinct noises. Their abilities to treat tinnitus and mask sounds unite them. Another thing that separates them from 1/f noise (with indirect proportional relationship to frequencies) is their direct proportional relationship to the changing frequencies. Additionally, blue noise is the sound of a hair spray and actively contributes to the computer graphics field with its production of good-quality visual resolution.
Gray Noise
Gray noise does not exist in nature. Programmed specifically to help tinnitus sufferers sleep better during noise therapy, gray noise contains the same amount of loudness throughout and is audible to humans’ ears.
Orange Noise
If orange noise were a vocalist, it would be the kind that sings everything out of tune. It is stripped of several bands, and the noise possessing many “sour” notes is the result that follows.
Green Noise
If you often find yourself productive through reconnecting with nature, there is a high chance you will click with this nature-based noise at first listen. Beach waves and waterfalls are two emerging examples of this environmental sound. If all you desire is a peaceful sleep in the forest, definitely go give this one a try.
Black Noise
Paul Simon wrote “The Sound of Silence” in 1964, and the title of this legendary song is perfect to describe this type of noise. Unlike other listed noises, black noise consists of absolute silence or near silence with just a bit of random noise or sounds beyond the limit of human hearing. With zero frequencies, black noise may be preferred by people who want little to no noise at bedtime.
In daily life, noise is usually perceived as distracting. However, like most things that have two sides, noises can be “noice.”
It’s time you hop on this noise exploration journey and find out the ultimate one for your next study or sleep sesh!"
2023-03-08,Amherst Needs to Pay Up,"
Nearly $2 million in endowment money per student, a sprawling 1,000 acres of land, and minimal money paid in taxes on the college’s property or the endowment. Which of these seems like the odd one out? Amherst College is a financial titan that is under little obligation to contribute its money to the common good. While the college pays a 1.4 percent tax on the gains from its endowment, and on the select minority of its properties which fall within town limits, it gains access to the privilege of tax-exemption beyond these modest concessions in part by virtue of its educational mission: to educate exceptional students from all backgrounds, so that they can then “give light to the world.” But what happens when the college fails to live up to its own ideals? If Amherst cannot live up to its mission — in essence, promoting educational access and public service — it should be made to support its community in other ways, like, for example, contributing more money to the town of Amherst.
Access and Service
Amherst’s tax-exempt status might be justifiable if the college showed its commitment for the common good in other ways — like, for example, building robust career pipelines that send a large number of students into public service jobs, or performing exceedingly well on social mobility metrics. The problem is Amherst does extremely poorly on both of these fronts.
Amherst has many names. Some know it as the “Singing College.” Others, the “Teaching College.” Yet, no one would ever dare call it the “Public Service College.” In fact, the college is one of the worst elite liberal arts colleges in this regard. A study by Washington Monthly ranked Amherst 17th out of the top-20 liberal arts colleges when it comes to sending graduates into social impact careers. This, put frankly, is unacceptable. Instead of committing disproportionate resources to consulting and finance pipelines — hosting weekly workshops for future bankers, for instance — Amherst should fully commit to its educational mission. It should do more than only pay lip service to public service. Amherst has only just begun to recognize its commitment to public service — hosting programs as a part of its new Social Impact Initiative dedicated to encouraging students to go into social impact careers — but these efforts are far from enough. The college should double down on its commitment to educating students for the common good, following in the footsteps of two outstanding institutions in this regard — Harvard, which created a Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship, and Swarthmore, which gives students $27,000 Social Impact Fellowships that provide recent graduates with housing in their first year working at a nonprofit.
Amherst College is far from being known for its social mobility either. In fact, New York Times data shows only 2 percent of Amherst students come from poor families but become rich adults. This places us 58th among Massachusetts colleges alone — and much worse nationally. If Amherst is to live up to its educational mission, it should make itself more accessible. While low-income students do have exceedingly high chances of moving up the socioeconomic ladder upon their arrival at Amherst, it’s important to remember that social mobility is defined by both success and access. If Amherst is faring poorly on social mobility metrics, it is because it is not providing a sufficient number of low-income students with access to such a remarkable institution — and the evidence for this claim is overwhelming. Amherst currently enrolls more students from the top 1 percent of the income distribution than from the entire bottom half combined — a blatant atrocity. Amherst must redouble its efforts to be accessible if it wants to truly live up to its educational mission.
The Community
Neither does Amherst live up to its educational mission locally. Pages on pages of research and writing show colleges have extremely detrimental effects on their surrounding communities, and Amherst is no different. If the college is to live up to its mission, it should support the town more. As an article in The Amherst Current states bluntly: “When an Amherst College student goes to Town Hall to register to vote or get a passport, the salaries of the clerks who help her are paid through Amherst property taxes.” Amherst and its students get to avail themselves of all the services of the larger town without the institution itself ever having to adequately contribute. This puts an excessive strain on the town and its finances. To be fair, Amherst does make an annual contribution to local schools — totalling $75,000 in 2021 — and pay $650,000 in property taxes on a select few properties it owns in town. However, it is important to recognize that, as the writers in The Amherst Current argue, “these payments, while welcomed, are not adequate to meet the demand that our academic institutions place on Town services.” Additionally, these figures pale in comparison to the near $10 million Amherst would pay if all of its properties were taxed. The failure to live up to its mission notwithstanding, Amherst should not get to pick and choose how it supports its own locality. The college should contribute more monetarily to the town more in an effort to support the community that gave rise to it and continuously allows it to thrive.
Conclusion
Anyone who’s read the Amherst insignia is familiar with the college’s motto: Terras Irradient, or “Let them give light to the world.” We should take it to mean that Amherst and its students are here to substantially contribute to the common good. In the face of the failure of the college to meet its mission, and the excessive strains it places on the surrounding town, the least the college could do is double down on efforts to promote access, equity, and public service, and contribute more money to the town of Amherst. After all, if Amherst is unwilling to live up to its mission educationally, why shouldn’t it have to commit to it monetarily?"
2023-03-08,Having Cancer at Amherst College,"
In the latter half of my freshman year, a funny feeling in my ear akin to a pulsating drumbeat led me to the Keefe Health Center. There, an owlish gentleman peered into my ear and exclaimed that I had a perfectly shaped canal. I returned to my dorm room, relieved of all ear-related anxieties.
That finals season, I took much longer than usual getting my exams in. When summer finally came, I rested for an initial month. Then I started working the three jobs I had lined up for the stretch leading into the 2021 school year. After my shifts, I would fall into bed and sleep for hours. I do not remember thinking that anything was wrong. I do not remember thinking much at all.
In the fall semester of my sophomore year, I was slated to arrive at Amherst College one week early for Community Advisor (CA) training. On the day of my flight to college, I projectile vomited all over the living room. My mother brought me to the ER, where I was diagnosed with an ear infection.
When I arrived on campus, I stopped functioning. I missed CA training sessions; I failed to speak articulately; I passed out in the dorm rooms of the Asian Culture House. To say that I shut myself into my dorm room would require intent on my part. In truth, I could not muster the strength to get out of bed in the sweltering heat. I texted my friends to bring me food from the cafeteria. They were told that it was against school policy.
I tried to get help. Once again I went to the Keefe Health Center. The nurses there took away the antibiotics I was taking for my ear infection.
The first time the ambulance was called on me, I threw up in the waiting room of Cooley Dickinson. I tried to speak to someone at the front desk. In response, they gave me a pail. I waited for hours. The doctor saw me for 10 minutes and discharged me with Tylenol. I was then stranded at Cooley Dickinson in the dark. I called my friend for help and he attempted to contact our supervisor, Alyssa Carlotto, who replied that she was off work. Finally — I do not know how or when — someone from Amherst called and informed me that Exclusive Car Services would be ferrying me back. I sat outside in the dark and waited while my head felt like it was being smashed by a hammer.
The weeks passed in a haze and classes began. I attended none of them. One day, I somehow wandered into the common room. My friends saw me and called the ambulance again. By then, complete aphasia had set in: I could not speak. Strapped to the stretcher, I texted a photo of my feet to my parents. The EMTs asked me questions I could not answer.
To this day, I remember what one of the EMTs said to a nurse at Cooley Dickinson when we arrived: “He can’t speak English. He’s mentally slow and inarticulate.”
I tried to object. I tried to tell them that I was a student at the college. I opened the notes app on my phone and attempted to type. I strained to scream, to cry out, for help. Nothing. I could not make a single sound. I was trapped in my own mind, in excruciating pain, as the medical staff who were supposed to help me brushed me off as an idiot who did not speak English because I am Asian.
It is perhaps a relief that I do not remember much of that night.
I woke up in Massachusetts General Hospital. My parents, who had flown in from Oregon, were by my side.
The night before, my mother’s desperation had saved my life. She had called and called my phone until a passing nurse finally noticed. My mother had frantically explained to her that I did, in fact, speak English, and that I was neither mentally slow nor inarticulate. During the subsequent CAT scan, the nurse had seen the tumor that eclipsed greater than a quarter of my brain. She had flooded me with steroids to reduce the swelling and sent me off to a more capable hospital.
If someone had not noticed, I would have had an aneurysm and died.
My consciousness vacated my physical body for the week before surgery. I did not know where I was; I did not know what year it was; I did not even know my own name. There are massive gaps in my memory up until the 11-hour brain surgery, but I recall passing flickers of little light in the swelling, tumorous dark.
This is what I choose to remember: My mother spooning cool, sweet watermelon onto my tongue. Two friends crying and stroking my arm as I tried and failed to form words in my hospital bed. My debate coach talking at me because he understood that I could not talk back. So many people sending concerned messages, well wishes, and desires to visit me. Professor Sarat, who taught my first-year seminar and who has also experienced cancer, comforting my crestfallen parents. My nurse cradling my head and whispering that she would put me at the top of her prayer list. My stepfather pulling me into a gentle bear hug as I cried over the uncertainty clouding my future. FaceTiming my grandmother and her sobbing upon seeing that I was alive, alive, alive. Finally, right before the sedation set in, my neurosurgeon giving me a high-five.
There is a sword that hangs over my head. Its name is grade 3 anaplastic ependymoma, and it is a rare brain cancer that will follow me for the rest of my life. I have had three brain surgeries, 39 sessions of radiation treatment, and months of chemotherapy since I took medical leave. I have experienced the restless aggression of steroids, the nausea of bitter-tasting chemotherapy medicine, and seizures that render my entire body helpless. I have had more near-death experiences than I can count.
But I choose to focus on the overwhelming kindness in my darkest moments and I weep with joy. Cancer is a sword, but it is also a reminder of human kindness, of soft touches and quiet connections. When I die, whether that be in five years or one hundred, may I have lived tenderly and lovingly, fluffy with empathy and heart. Amid the genetic mutations and surgery scars, there is an undeniable beauty that traces the preciousness of my single human life.
This I have learned: During a burial is when the flowers come."
2023-03-08,Myth-Busting the Starving Artist: Reflections from AHA Program,"
At the end of January, right before the start of this semester, I had the opportunity to be a part of the inaugural cohort of the Arts and Humanities in Action program, or AHA, as we all affectionately called it. Helmed by Professor of Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought and Political Science Austin Sarat and Executive Director of the Loeb Center Emily Griffen, the program was for the humanists walking a tightrope — certain of their love of artistic pursuits, yet afraid that their passions wouldn’t guarantee security in bank account balance. 
Let me state the not-so-obvious: if you have a humanities degree, it is entirely possible to get a job, and it can be a very good one. Throughout this program, we met with multiple Amherst humanities professors and alumni who are proof of this exact sentiment.
I say “not-so-obvious” because if you’re like me and have ever vocalized a preference for a humanities major, you’ve likely been scoffed at or met with shocked expressions quickly buried under disingenuous smiles. We are often met with additional questions: “And what else?” or “Is that it?” Every career-related conversation turns into a police interrogation where you’re having the book thrown at you because you said you like to write!
As a kind of case study, I present Amherst alum Matt Collins ’94, who visited us during the program. Working as the head of product marketing at the marketing platform MNTN (pronounced Mountain), Collins explained that the liberal arts education that he received as an English major at Amherst College has directly enabled him to complete the job that he has today. At Amherst, he gained three critical skills that many employers across disciplines, himself included, seek in their candidates:
These are skills introduced in every humanities course and honed in every humanities major. And Amherst College is among the best places to master these skills.
Though I was grateful to hear how the humanities can prepare students for hybrid humanities-STEM career paths like Collins’, I want to pursue a more traditional humanities career packed with every ounce of risk.
It may be naive, but like a fourth-place beauty pageant contestant, I want to make the world a better place through my art (I am aiming for world peace if I can!) At the very least, I don't want to end up working for some corporation where I inadvertently code some people deeper into poverty. Or, if I’m working at some firm in New York, visit the Vessel too often during my lunch breaks.
Going into the program I knew I wanted to be an author, but that didn’t mean I had nothing to gain from my experience. I found the conversations with faculty and alumni to be illuminating. I delved into cover letters, resumes, and the art of networking. But the greatest spark of the week occurred when Professor of Music and Director of the Center for Humanistic Inquiry (CHI) Darryl Harper spoke to us about the myth of the “starving artist.”
We all know the image quite well: a watermarked stock photo (or ironic sketch) of the tortured creative dressed in tattered clothing with their weight in dues, whose mind was simply not enough to sustain them in the real world.
Drawing from Lewis Hyde’s “The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World,” Professor Harper explained that art exists in two economies: the market economy and the gift economy. Art can survive without the market economy, but it cannot live without the gift economy.
Art as a gift means it exists to bind us all together; it’s in service of other people. 
His lesson was not about modifying your passions into something profitable in today’s context. Instead, it was for us artists, to understand the choices that we are making and the life we imbue our creations with.
You can make money in art was the presentation's ultimate point. The world will always need and benefit from it. Furthermore, the starving artist is a myth because an artist cannot truly starve if hunger is a measure of fulfillment; to make art is to be continually nourishing and nourished.

I had confidence, but I needed the inspiration to believe that anything I could accomplish might be meaningful to other people. I gained that through this program.
I am endlessly grateful to all of the professors and alumni, as well as Emily Griffen, Professor Sarat, and all those working behind the scenes who believe so deeply in me and my peers. The AHA program offers an authentic view of the real world, proving that there’s nothing humanities majors cannot do. Plus, they took us to the musical “Hamilton” in Boston, so it’s definitely worth it!"
2023-03-01,The Open Curriculum Isn’t Dead: In Defense of the New Latin Honors Policy,"
The new amendments to the Latin honors policy have proven to be highly controversial among the student body, with many denouncing it as the end of all the things they love so much about Amherst’s academic culture. It seems to me, however, that the new Latin honors policy is defensible, and I argue that it should be welcomed as a positive change on campus.
But first, let me lay my cards out flat: I’m an Association of Amherst Students (AAS) representative on the Committee on Educational Policy, which was responsible for proposing the change to the faculty. I’ve worked directly on the policy amendments — and I’ve spent a lot of time discussing its merits. I understand that I, maybe more than others, have something at stake in how these changes are received. But still, I find most of the arguments being made against the new policy just don’t hold weight. I’ll be addressing arguments made against the breadth requirement, and then moving to argue for how other changes to the policy promote risk-taking and advance curricular equity.
The Breadth Requirement
The most frequent argument made against the new breadth requirement is that it will silently kill the open curriculum and destroy our lively classroom culture. Students will be forced to take classes they otherwise wouldn’t have taken. They’ll be less inclined to participate, and classroom discussions will be dull. However, this all stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to pursue Latin honors. In the event that a student should choose to go for Latin honors — the same way they might choose to pursue the pre-med track, for example — they’ve placed upon themselves a number of subjective limitations they then have to fulfill in order to achieve their goal. The same way a student who wishes to become a doctor has to take “Organic Chemistry,” a student who wants to graduate summa will have to take a single course in each of four broad academic categories: humanities, social sciences, STEM, and the arts. If there are restrictions placed on a student’s academic freedom, it’s only because they chose to put them on themselves.
Those who say the new policy destroys our classrooms can be countered in one of two ways. Firstly, going back to the pre-med analogy, is it the case that because pre-med students are forced to take chemistry, for example, that all of Amherst’s chemistry classes are dull and boring? No, because the students still need to do well. No med school is going to accept a straight-D pre-med student, and no student that has a median grade below A- can qualify for Latin honors. Secondly, I think we can agree that calling our classroom culture lively is a bit of an exaggeration. I’m sure many of us have been in intro classes in which the same four students were the only ones who spoke. At its worst, the new policy couldn't possibly make this worse.
Many who criticize the change also argue that it will reinforce age-old academic divides, and make Amherst students more competitive. To the first point, if it can be said that naming four divisions of academic study implicitly communicates to students that different areas of study don’t influence each other — that, for example, STEM students have nothing to learn from the humanities — then what does that say about the major system as a whole? Is it the case that an economics major has nothing to learn from a Sexuality, Women's & Gender Studies (SWAGS) class simply because they’ve declared themselves in economics and the SWAGS class doesn’t fulfill a requirement? Naming and differentiating a discipline does not necessitate that it be isolated from the influences of other subjects.
Arguments about how the new policy only makes students more competitive appear to be both inconsistent and lacking a complete understanding of the changes to the Latin honors requirements. Firstly, many argue that having the breadth requirement forces students to have to adjust their course plans early on in order to be able to fulfill each of the four requirements. This, to me, appears to be inconsistent with the supposed value of the open curriculum: New courses are created every year, and amazing new professors are hired all the time. Thus, having a four-year course plan would be completely at odds with what the open curriculum has to offer. In addition, the new policy, by removing the class rank requirement, has actually made things less competitive, as students will no longer have to compete with their classmates for a spot in the top quarter of their class.
Furthermore, the entire premise that we’d be forcing a large number of students into classes they wouldn’t otherwise have taken seems largely false. Data from the new Latin honors proposal shows that over half of Amherst students naturally fulfill the Latin honors requirement. And at most, it would put a typical student in a position where they would only have to take one extra class.
The new breadth requirement stems from the idea that a student graduating with Latin honors should exemplify the highest ideals of a liberal arts education — that they should be academically eclectic. One might argue against this by saying that what’s done for the best of us should apply to the rest of us: that if the best of all Amherst students are required to fulfill the breadth requirement, why aren’t all of us? To that, I’d raise the question of why that has yet to be brought up about the thesis requirement. If the best of us are required to write theses, why aren’t the rest of us? It seems to be the case that one may be able to justifiably wish one thing for the most highly motivated students and a separate thing for the others, without it being something that necessarily denigrates the latter group. After all, isn’t that what all those honors and AP classes we took in high school were about? Not every student needs to — or should — fulfill the requirements for honors.
Promoting Risks
Amherst students are already pretty risk-averse as it is, and the old Latin honors policy, based on class rank, seemed to only make it worse. Being that only the top 25 percent of the class was eligible for honors before, students seeking Latin honors were incentivized to take the easiest classes they could and use a pass-fail option for anything below an A. The new policy, having removed the class rank requirement, takes away this perverse incentive within our curricular system and allows students to take more risks.
Advancing Equity
The old Latin honors policy made it much harder for students from underrepresented backgrounds to graduate with honors. First-generation and/or low-income students, for example, who come to Amherst having yet to become accustomed to the workings of elite institutions, were at a distinct disadvantage. While their peers are more likely to arrive at Amherst with a solid sense of what it takes to succeed, many first-gen students, through no fault of their own, struggle to achieve the sense of ease their privileged peers have — sometimes resulting in them having worse first-year grades. This, previously, may have been enough to rule them out of gaining honors.
The new policy makes graduating with honors all the more accessible, ensuring students who make mistakes have greater legroom to achieve in spite of them. It should be praised not only in this respect, but for all the reasons I’ve given above. It’s time we as students stop lamenting the death of the open curriculum, and welcome this progressive change to our academic structure.

2023-03-01,Fizz Should Go Flat,"
Last week, within 48 hours of its launch, a new social media app called Fizz took over the screens of the college’s students. The college-specific app, which was started in 2021 by Stanford drop-outs and requires a phone number and “.edu” email verification, allows users to post anonymously. You may have discovered it when you got a free donut from the paid student ambassadors tabling in Valentine Dining Hall. You might even be a student moderator, paid $500 a month to post upwards of 30 times a day and take down flagged posts. Even if you haven’t downloaded the app, you’ve likely felt the splash it has made on campus — for better or for worse.
Through lighthearted jokes about the inexplicable disappearance of Val’s cherished miso-marinated salmon or the complaints about the recent bouts of heavy snow, the app has created solidarity among our student body. Fizz undeniably does a good job at providing a space for Amherst-specific discourse. However, the ease with which that space has been misused and what it reveals about our community means that the negatives outweigh the positives.
The biggest danger of the app is precisely the reason why it is so popular and why it has been so effective in starting community discourse: its anonymity. Students can say what they want without fear of community retribution, which allows for users to bond over trivial matters without assuming responsibility for their comments, but it also means that students can quickly type offensive and potentially harmful messages and send them off within seconds without a single concern for backlash or consequences. At a small college like Amherst, anonymity is at once appealing and detrimental.
Anonymous platforms are nothing new, even to Amherst. Ranging from international to locally-based, they’re plentiful on the internet, including spaces like Reddit and Fizz’s somewhat disgraced and cyberbullying-ridden predecessor, YikYak. Anonymous intellectual discourse on our own campus was encouraged by the emergence of the controversy-sparking Contra in 2022, a publication for writers to publish divisive opinions without their names.
The danger of anonymity on Fizz, like these platforms, is the lack of accountability for harmful and misinformed voices. In just its first dozen hours, the app was already flooded with troubling “Fizzes,” including posts calling out students by name, climate change denial, racist remarks, rampant hyper-sexualization of women, and body-shaming, among other harmful comments. The risk of offensive content like this is exacerbated by Amherst’s comparatively small student body: Everyone knows each other, which makes calling someone out by name all the more harmful.
The harmful potential of Fizz, relative to the aforementioned platforms, is augmented by its lack of a consistent approach to privacy and content monitoring. The process for the deletion of a post usually first involves a report by a user and a review by a student moderator. There are two things which make this system flawed: the bias of the student moderators, who may have their own beliefs and personal ties to the community, and the potential for a post to cause harm before the moderator can respond to a report. The lack of a consistent, full-time, unbiased moderator staff means that harmful racist, sexist, homophobic, threatening, and/or violent posts can slip through the cracks.
Inconsistent moderation is emblematic of the company’s approach to safety concerns and trustworthiness. In 2021, student researchers at Stanford found that personally identifiable user information — names, emails, and more — was easily accessible to hackers. These researchers were later threatened by Fizz’s legal team. Privacy and data concerns are no small issue, and Fizz’s dismissal of this matter says a lot about its company values.
The most alarming aspect of Fizz is not only its potential for serious harm to individuals but also the way it presents a striking reflection of the student body. Aside from the vulgarity and the cyberbullying, many posts also affirm serious, community-wide concerns about racism, sexism, homophobia, the administration, professors, rape culture, mental health, and more. While more community forums about these subjects are necessary, this app is not the right place for intentional and critical community engagement focused on real change. The eagerness with which students criticize campus life on Fizz seems at odds with the widespread lack of involvement the student body has with organizations like the Association of Amherst Students. Energy directed toward Fizz should be redirected toward these campus resources if students want to see change that actually benefits the community.
Fizz, at its best, is a poor attempt to fulfill a social desire for anonymous expression. But at its worst, it capitalizes off students’ instincts for drama and controversy, dividing rather than uniting. It’s better left uninstalled.

Unsigned editorials represent the views of the majority of the Editorial Board — (assenting: 17; dissenting: 4; abstaining: 0)."
2023-03-01,Celebrating International Writers’ Day: Editors Deserve A Day for Themselves,"
At Amherst, we arduously carve out a path that sets us apart — a major, an on-campus job, clubs, the list goes on. All these distinctions on campus are in part possible thanks to the personal statement in our college application. While it is undoubtedly a product of our hard work and determination, it also reflects the effort of the editors — those who restructured our essay to emphasize our potential.
After we got admitted, we continued to write — reading responses, film scripts, essays, and poems for publications like The Indicator and The Lilac. As we do, editors continue to play a consistent role in guiding us through our uncertainties as we try to express ourselves with words. Personally, I made sense of how precious they are through my time at The Student.
I came to Amherst in February of 2022. Here, alongside the cohort of other students who had just arrived on campus, I spent my time figuring out how to register for classes, making mental notes of my favorite dishes at Val, and exploring the communities I was interested in joining. Given poor weather conditions and a cramped class schedule, the task of searching for a particular place that fit my niche presented a challenge. But as luck would have it, my prayer was finally answered: As March neared, I stumbled upon a post in the Daily Mammoth bulletin from The Amherst Student looking for a news writer.
Having read The Student’s articles, I understood that the actual task required more than what I was capable of. I had never done news reporting before, and I saw The Student as a place where people delved into strenuous work without days off. I got scared and swiped through the post. One week later, I happened to see the post again while browsing my laptop towards the end of my COSC-111 lecture. This time, my instincts told me to peruse the content. The moment I saw the line “no experience required,” I gathered up the courage and sent an email to one of the news editors at the time. It was this random attempt at trying new things that led to a new land of self-discovery and new friendships.
During my first drop-in meeting with the news team, I handed in an eight-page report of an “Alumni-in-Residence” event with so much excitement. The editors praised the piece, which made me feel very happy, but I was aghast by the number of edits that they left on the Google document. Reading through the editors’ comments, I quickly learned that an article was not just about the information. Unlike essays, it was more about delivering key events and people within a limited amount of words. But the meticulous feedback on that document set off my motivation, and continuing to write for The Student based solely on that factor turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made.
Fall 2022 quickly approached and the weather became much more pleasant. Like a puzzle with all the edge pieces placed, everything started to settle in for me. Thanks to the endearingly encouraging words from the editors’ weekly emails, I was hurled into a world that fostered new ideas for the stories that I wanted to share. For the first time, I entered the newsroom of The Student, where I saw how they produced impressive articles and made revisions to other writers’ work against the ticking clock every Tuesday night. What took me hours to get done took them half the time, and witnessing this flawless clockwork made me want to be a part of the team.
Talking to the editors about my potential writing topics was similar to sharing an academic plan with a counselor, but what was invigorating about it was that I gained access to their life experiences and their inner souls. They were perfect examples that demonstrated the possibility of pure joy in any corner of the world, as long as you have the passion and purpose for something you do.
As I was creating my own voice, I found myself not making any progress. The emphasis on style differed as I jumped between sections (from News to Arts and Living to Features to Opinion), and these people were guiding me from day one. They gave me advice that would later feed into my work. No AI writing service would be able to do that properly. Together, we worked out something that both alluringly invited readership and saved for me a core memory about specific parts of my college journey.
By staying open to new suggestions from my editors, I got to savor the merit of collaborative creation in literary works — something that I took away from the first chapter of Jack Stillinger’s “Multiple Authorship and the Myth of Solitary Genius” in ARHA-155 during the fall 2022 semester. Readers may see me as the only author of the narrative, but the substance of its finalized version is inseparable from multiple modifications and rewordings. Clearly, even a teeny-weeny change in punctuation has a significant influence on the original text — and this is vital to every well-structured story.
My time spent on campus with the editors was brief, but I finally understood what it meant to be in a tight-knit community. It is a community within a community, and getting to know these people who have a great sense of humor and exceptional work ethic was a saving grace for the unpredictable weather and notorious high-stress culture at Amherst. I read somewhere that we might not have an innate talent for doing something, but what we all have is the aptitude to learn. During my short time writing for different sections of the newspaper and talking to different editors, they showed me that my opportunities to learn and improve are limitless. For the first time, I found out how much I loved writing, and became serious about embarking on a career that had writing as a central element.
March 3 is International Writers’ Day and is annually observed to appreciate writers of all kinds in the world. On that same note, editors begin as writers. They work their way up through trial and error, and as their writing skill becomes solidified, they take care of other writers’ work. They do not only make edits to our drafts, but they ask questions that challenge writers to rethink sentences and word choices more logically. To me specifically, the task of an Amherst Student editor goes beyond refining words: They carry on their shoulders the legacies and traditions of one of the oldest college newspapers, reinforce the freedom of the press, and shape the standards for stories worth telling for generations to come. Because of them, fresh incoming writers walk in feeling supported and ready for the mission of keeping the college community well aware of its surroundings. For these (and so many other) reasons, editors deserve a day just for themselves.
As we celebrate all writers from all around the world, I urge us to leave some space to express our gratitude to the editors — editors from your literary organization, associates from the college’s writing center, and advisors for your thesis, and anyone else that has helped elevate your writing skill to where it is today.
To my editors, thank you for working endlessly, rain or shine, to make sure my work is nothing short of its best version. No matter how much time has flown by, nothing has changed about the fact that you amplified my voice and that you forever changed my life. That effort has never gone unnoticed.

2023-03-01,AHA! The Not-So-Shocking Truth That Every Arts and Humanities Major Wishes You Knew,"
I perched on the edge of my seat, held captive by the opening lines of “Hamilton: The Musical.” Aaron Burr stands before me, so close and yet so far away, tied to the present by a melody. This same melody casts a net over the audience, binding me to the past for a few brief moments, before releasing me into the frosty night, the vestiges of song clinging to my mind long after this night has passed.
As I stepped out of the theater that January evening, I thought of the program that was soon to be over but whose lessons now weave around my compatriots and I just like the musical memories we shared. Though it only spanned the last week of January, the Arts and Humanities in Action (AHA) program would continue to follow me through the next several weeks, and I have no doubt that it shall continue to do so for many years to come. The AHA program forever altered my definition of success, as well as my view of the steps necessary to attain it, and that is why I would personally recommend this program to everyone, regardless of definitive plans to major in the arts or humanities.
The AHA program is a brand-new J-Term program led by William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science and Chair of Political Science Austin Sarat and Director of the Loeb Center Emily Griffen. As the name might suggest, it is geared towards first-year students interested in majoring in the arts or humanities, a decision that often comes with a barrage of questions, none of which are particularly encouraging. The program intends to help students explore career options, connect with alumni, and plan their next steps in their professional development. It assists in internship searching and in the development of valuable workplace skills, which to first-years is the equivalent of gold.
Heading into the AHA program, I thought that to achieve success, one needed to do the most, to be the most that they possibly could. Signing up for everything regardless of personal interest, pandering to the needs of future employers, thinking only of programs that would look good on resumés, not ones that I actually wanted to do. These were the steps to success in my mind. Like many first-years, I was stuck in the application mindset. Having worked my entire life to get to a college like Amherst, it’s difficult to slow down when moving at a breakneck speed is what got me here in the first place. The AHA program reminded me that it’s okay to take a breath. I’m allowed to take a photography class because it interests me, not because it’s going towards anything in particular. The AHA program reminded me of why I am here, at Amherst College, but it also reminded me that it’s not necessary to continue trying to earn my place at Amherst when I’m already here.
Toward the beginning of the program many students opened up about the negative stereotypes around majoring in the arts or humanities. Needless to say, confusion and pity are common responses — at least from those who doubt their professional merit — when one announces their plans to be an arts or humanities major. Students often hear that they will end up destitute and depressed should they choose to pursue this foolish path. With this aura of skepticism, it’s no wonder that the arts and humanities majors regret their degrees the most once they graduate. But as we would come to learn during the AHA program, it isn’t that these degrees don’t prepare you well for a career. It’s that we are trained to believe that an arts or humanities major only prepares you for poverty, so that’s all one expects to achieve.
Throughout the course of the AHA program, we met with various Amherst faculty and alumni, all of whom gave presentations on the value of an arts or humanities major. These ranged from Chair of the Music Department and Director of the Center for Humanistic Inquiry Darryl Harper’s presentation on the myth of the starving artist to a talk with the Amherst Investment Office on the importance of relationship skills in investment banking. The AHA program engaged us in conversations that worked to break the stigma surrounding arts and humanities majors. It aimed to prove that with such a major, we could still go on to be, as Sarat drily described, “rich, greedy, and mean.” Of course, I doubt that these three goals were at the top of any of our to-do lists, but the message was clear. With an arts or humanities major, we could choose to be rich, greedy, and mean. We could also choose to be poor, selfless, and kind, or anything in between. The skills developed through work in the arts and humanities — teamwork, communication, critical thinking, reading and writing, and many more — would allow us to pursue any dream, conquer any obstacle, and shatter any glass ceiling or brick wall that might be in our way.
On the second to last day of the program, we were given the opportunity to visit Boston and speak with various alumni working in the city. We dined, laughed, and learned together, all while eagerly awaiting the reveal of the surprise we had been promised earlier in the day. As a long time “Hamilfan,” I was thrilled to learn that we would get to see a showing of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical masterpiece (as were my compatriots, to varying degrees). But the more I reflect on that week, the more I believe that the true surprise was never really “Hamilton.” Instead, my “AHA!” moment was leaving not with the hope that an arts or humanities degree would help me succeed in life, but with the knowledge that there was no better way to do so. In other, perhaps far greater words, do not throw away your shot, and consider joining us in the glorious future of being an arts and humanities major.

2023-02-22,Why I Don’t Wear Seatbelts,"
I don’t wear seatbelts. Or — so I don’t give readers the wrong impression — it’s less that I actively choose not to wear seatbelts and more that I consistently, inevitably forget to wear them.
The reason for this is simple: for most of my life, I didn’t have to wear them. In my home country, Bangladesh, a seatbelt is like an appendix: you know that it exists in principle, and you might even be aware of its presence from time to time, but functionally, you have no use for it. Usually, the people in the driver’s and passenger’s seats do wear them — mostly to stop that horridly incessant beeping — but even they often fasten their seatbelt behind their body because comfort is of utmost necessity, of course, when driving.
And so, throughout my childhood, I never wore a seatbelt. And because this was the normal way of life for all Bangladeshis, I never came to realize how abnormal my notion of car safety was until I came to the U.S. as a teenager, stepped into a friend’s parent’s car, and was reminded, as if I was a child, to put my seatbelt on.
This event has occurred over and over: each time I get into the car of anyone outside of family, I am reminded to put on my seatbelt — escalating to the point that my friends learned to assiduously verify this fact each time we were in a car together. Keys? Check. Wallet? Check. Tapti put on her seatbelt? Check.
This, long after I feel that I have integrated myself into American culture relatively well, has been the longstanding remnant of my South Asian habits. In many ways, I feel that I can “pass” relatively well as a native — my accent’s relatively “natural,” my way of dressing reassuringly “normal” (although you would not believe the looks I get when I wrap my hair in a headscarf for bad hair days) — this, to many people I know, remains one of my only standouts of foreignness.
This winter, back home in Dhaka with my family, and perhaps more predisposed to ponderance than usual, I wondered why, despite the many ways I have assimilated, I couldn’t quite assimilate in this regard. And the answer, I’ve realized, is my mother.
Because, in the myriad of ways that I made sense of the new culture around me as a young teenager in a foreign land, it was my mother who first started my journey and led the way for me. It was her who taught me how to swipe the pass on the bus and metro when we first landed in the U.S., her who taught me the necessity of tipping, her who reminded me to say please and thank you and excuse me every five minutes since “politeness matters a lot in American culture” (this, despite being much less fluent in English than I was at the time). It was her who walked me through the different names produce had at the grocery store (bell pepper instead of capsicum was a big shocker to me), introduced me to the joyous concept of dollar stores, and encouraged me to go out and explore the city for myself.
But despite the lengths she went to ensure that her child would, at least on the surface, be regarded as “one of them,” she never had me put on a seatbelt in her car. This is less a result of her not caring about road safety (to the contrary, my mom always ensures to drive at exactly the speed limit — it’s quite impressive), and more her own habits in this regard guiding her way: seatbelts were out of sight, out of mind. And because she never reminded me to put on my seatbelt in the backseat, I never learnt to. So now, unfortunately, despite the hopes of many people around me, it’s probably been ingrained enough in my brain that I probably never will.
I don’t know why — but I have a strange sense of joy about that. Perhaps it’s reassurance, in a sense, that no matter how Americanized I’ve become in my years studying abroad, no matter how much I “pass,” I hold my cultural identity in my heart in this strange, non-consequential way.

2023-02-22,New Latin Honors Breadth Requirements are an Inadequate Spring Cleaning,"
Last week’s faculty reassessment of the qualifications for Latin honors is a mixed bag. On one hand, the changes to the grade requirements for earning honors do not devalue students’ achievement of Latin honors. There is no harm in honoring a greater proportion of the graduating class — commencement may take a little longer, but it’s still the same cane and the same resume tinsel. That move, in pushing beyond meaningless differences in grade point averages, is a good one. And English honors still exist for those who take pleasure in looking down their noses at fellow classmates.
The new “breadth requirement,” on the other hand, has been subject to far more histrionics. Despite some protestations to the contrary, the decision is not the end of the world as we know it, and its limited application to Latin honors conferral means it does not explicitly contradict the open curriculum. Nonetheless, the requirement’s implication that the exemplary Amherst student should take classes across haphazard categories misapprehends the value of a liberal arts education.
Siloing academic departments into categories hinging on whether students wield pipettes or paintbrushes more often reinforces the same disciplinary divisions that lead students to write off seemingly disparate academic areas in the first place. There is no reason that honors eligibility should be contingent upon enrolling in at least one class in the arts, humanities, science and mathematics, and social and behavioral sciences, because categorizing on this scale cuts jaggedly across boundaries that are by nature communicative. Moreover, an English major is not “risk-averse” if they opt to chance a Russian or a European studies class instead of a chemistry lecture. A graduate is no less laudable because they focused their course selection on one, two, or three of the four designated quadrants of knowledge during their tenure at Amherst.
A liberal arts education is not a scavenger hunt. It’s about recognizing the enormous potential for further learning in every discipline. If the faculty wanted to institute a requirement for Latin honors that courses be taken in 10 different departments, including cross-designated courses, that would be emblematic of a “willingness to explore unfamiliar intellectual and/or creative fields.” But, as is most egregiously demonstrated by the 24 departments included in the “humanities” column, the requirements’ categorizations do not constitute “fields of expertise” — taking a Latinx and Latin American studies course does not augment your Latin, for one of many possible examples. For that matter, no 12-course major makes anyone an expert on anything, certainly not on 23 other departments, nor is it trying to.
A student who over their four years takes classes in one gigantic clump of departments is just as committed to the Amherst mission — “undertaking inquiry and … shaping their education within and beyond the curriculum” — as any other. The idea that a graduate has failed to meet Amherst’s highest standards if they took courses solely in the “humanities” or “arts” or “STEM” is a slap on the wrist to thousands of alums since the establishment of the open curriculum.
To a less grievous extent, the “breadth requirements” for Latin honors suggest a breakdown in professors’ trust in their pupils. Amherst’s supplemental essays last year were responses to quotes by professors on ideas in their fields. This prerequisite for admission served both to demonstrate respect for faculty passions and the chance to state our own. It is a departure from that ethos to determine for students what they should be interested in. Admissions panels vet students to ensure that they know how to identify their interests, and that they are eager to engage with faculty in developing those interests.
Amherst’s advising program is ostensibly quite strong. If some faculty feel that they cannot compel their advisees to enroll in courses in a variety of subjects, then the solution is not imposing courses valued by how far they fall from the student’s stated interest. A solution might entail more face-time with the advisee or work to identify more desirable courses outside of their comfort zone, but certainly not dangling a “magna” behind the gates of one course or another. Bribing ambitious students with Latin lettering is far from the most thoughtful or creative solution to the campus-wide course diversity problem.
Certainly, the purpose of the breadth requirement is to serve as a vehicle by which faculty encourage students to deviate from their major track and core interest, and to reject a purely pre-professional college experience. These are noble goals — but conflating the exploration of unfamiliar disciplines with ticking off mishmashed fields of study misses the point. It’s not the end of the world, but it is a half-measure that, rather than bolstering Amherst’s broad array of excellent courses, perfunctorily color-codes them."
2023-02-22,Certificates Consulting 101: Which One to Have?,"
It is evident that we are approaching a stage where access to learning resources is more widely available than ever before. By virtue of the rapid growth in online training programs, preparing for certification exams has become much easier. However, in the midst of a horde of certifications, it can feel suffocating just merely deciding which one to focus your energy and effort on. If that’s the case, let this article be a quick guide to certificates that are cost-friendly, time-efficient, and most importantly, catered to the support provided by Amherst College during our four years here.
Microsoft Office Specialist
Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) certification focuses on assessing exam takers’ demonstrated proficiency in each of its primary products such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. With no expiration date, MOS is, without a doubt, one of the most valuable certificates that strengthens your confidence with Microsoft tools.
As Amherst students, we are gifted by the college a license to access to Microsoft 365 Pro Plus. This allows us to practice MOS exam problems on the real platform itself before taking the exam. In addition, Amherst also indirectly supports MOS exam training by sponsoring our LinkedIn Learning account. Log in to Linkedin Learning with your Amherst account, and search for “MOS Certification” in the search bar. There, you will be able to find results filtered just for your MOS cert prep journey. Tiny tip for a more beneficial start: Take the “PowerPoint Associate - Microsoft Office Specialist for Office 2019 and Office 365” course first, then Word, then the notorious formula-filled Excel.
Following Covid social distancing protocols, Microsoft made it possible for students to finish the exam from home. This remote version of the exam is still valid after the pandemic, and Amherst students like us probably enjoy this policy the most, given that the nearest authorized testing center from Amherst is Boston-based (which equals two to three hours of traveling)!
Teaching English as a Second Language / Teaching English as a Foreign Language
Yes, you can certainly become an online English teacher while still in college! By earning Teaching English as a Second Language (TESOL) and Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TFL) certifications, you are sure to improve your chances when you apply to accredited English teaching service providers. While both these certifications may require you to pay, there are ways to earn them at no cost.

For starters, you can finish your TFL course, all at your own pace and free, courtesy of Teacher Record. While obtaining TFL sets you up for an international teaching career abroad, TESOL is the preferable of the two because it lets you teach both in other countries and in the States. Complete your TESOL certification for free by applying for financial aid to the total eight courses in Arizona State University TESOL Professional Certificate program on Coursera. All you need are two short statements, one on your reason to file the aid app and the other on how the course will benefit your goals.
Microsoft Learn Free Training and Certification
Microsoft has been working on initiatives that equip the young generation with foundations to climb the tech-savvy career ladder. Besides the rebranded Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Program that started in 2020, it also offers both training procedures and exam vouchers for eight certificates to all eligible students at no charge until June 2023. These certificates are ideal solutions that help you form an accustomed and acute sense of today’s most in-demand technologies.
The first thing you need to do is create a personal account on Microsoft, select the course of your interest, and verify your Amherst student status on the Cloud Ready Skills platform, an initiative on behalf of Microsoft.
Even in the middle of the super busy spring semester, there is no better time than the present to complete the kind of certifications that will enable you to build up your technical knowledge of valuable skills such as data analysis, security, and artificial intelligence.
Adobe Certified Professional
Formerly called Adobe Certificate Associate, the program redesigned to align with the industry’s expectations can be helpful for many creatives on campus. Once again, Amherst is expanding its students’ choices with software solutions by enabling all students to install and run Adobe CC on their devices. That means you only need to pay for the exam cost, which is around $150, without being encumbered by the exorbitanly priced individual license.
For those who are well-versed in Adobe products, you probably think that your skills are the most legitimate proof already, think again. Nowadays, companies are valuing these credentials more than ever, and come to value candidates who, despite knowing the application like the back of their hand, still manage to take time to study Adobe properly.

Liberal Arts Collaborative for Digital Innovation’s Digital Summer Course
Liberal Arts Collaborative for Digital Innovation (LACOL)’s free and asynchronous digital course is an annual exclusive ticket for Amherst students to join force with students from other ten peer colleges in the consortium in unconventional projects concerning humanities. With success in engaging students with workload in Data Science and Digital Humanities utilizing cross-college archives in the previous summers, LACOL 2023 Summer expects to be joined by a new course in Applied Machine Learning.

The only caveat is that slots are limited, so refrain from waiting until the course’s recruitment announcement (usually in March). Raise your chance of acceptance by reaching out to the faculty member in charge and express your interest in participating.
As we graduate from school and enter the workforce, many of us will endlessly study to complete certification programs required for our practice and profession. However, at the college level, the certifications above, and similar programs, are already an important way you can solidify an array of beneficial skills. By adding these, you can improve your immediate productivity and open up yourself to multiple career options at the same time. It is one of the many creative ways to make the most out of our college life by leveraging resources available through the college."
2023-02-15,The Quiet Death of the Open Curriculum,"
Whenever someone asks me why I chose to attend Amherst, my first answer is usually the open curriculum. Few other colleges offer students complete freedom to choose their course of study, as Amherst does (apart from the classes required for a major). To me, the open curriculum represents Amherst’s commitment to students’ intellectual autonomy. Our lack of a core curriculum and distribution requirements ensures that students take classes they want to take, not classes they’re forced to take. When I enter the classroom, I know that all of my classmates want to be there.
This will all change beginning with the class of 2027. Last Tuesday, the faculty passed a proposal to amend the Latin honors program. Students and faculty alike have long expressed dissatisfaction that the honors program depends upon class rank. The proposal, written by a committee of professors and Association of Amherst Students senators, addresses this common complaint by shifting from a GPA-percentile requirement to one based on the median of all your final class grades (higher than an A- for summa, and equal to or higher than A- for magna). Students will know for certain whether they achieved their desired median grade instead of guessing whether they made the top 25 percent of their class.
But I’m concerned by the proposal’s second clause: the introduction of “breadth requirements” for students pursuing magna and summa cum laude. In addition to writing a thesis and meeting the GPA requirement, Latin honors students will need to take at least one class each in the “arts, humanities, sciences and mathematics, and social and behavioral sciences.”
The breadth requirement may seem like a minor detail that encourages students to explore the liberal arts — something we should do regardless. It may also boost Amherst’s humanities numbers at a time when humanities enrollment nationwide is shrinking, which I fully support as an English major. However, I argue that this amendment to Latin honors will fundamentally change the spirit of Amherst and, ultimately, mark the end the open curriculum.
Although it may sound as though the breadth requirement only applies to a select group of high-achievers, in reality, it will affect a huge portion of campus. Around 50 percent of Amherst students choose to write a thesis, which is the primary requisite for Latin honors. If the majority of the college must fulfill distribution requirements, no matter how mild they are, how can we claim to have an open curriculum? Even if some thesis-writers choose not to pursue magna or summa honors, I imagine that most would at least like to try. Writing a thesis is arguably the most arduous element of earning Latin honors, so meeting the breadth requirement may seem trivial in comparison. And thus a tweak to Latin honors requirements suddenly transforms Amherst’s entire curriculum.
Once the changes go into effect, Amherst’s classrooms will be filled with people who don’t want to be there. Professors who already worry about lack of participation in class discussions will face even more apathy from students who only want to check off a box. The breadth requirement doesn’t guarantee intellectual risk-taking because students can simply seek out easier courses in departments they dislike. It may even hurt the students who are risk-takers. As Assistant Professor of Computer Science Matteo Riondato noted during the faculty meeting wherein the proposal was passed, some students may have developed an expertise through self-study and choose not to take courses in this area. These students would be forced to spend a class slot on a subject they already know well when they could instead take new and challenging courses in another department.
The changes to Latin honors will undermine Amherst’s collaborative and learning-based environment. As students begin to consider breadth requirements while choosing courses, an uneasy divide will emerge between those who pursue honors and those who don’t.
Amherst has a remarkably uncompetitive culture among elite institutions and few students openly discuss their academic aspirations. I’m a sophomore and I’ve never heard anyone announce their plans to graduate with honors. However, I fear that increasing the academic demands for Latin honors will encourage competition and credentialism. Students will need to decide whether they want to go for honors even earlier thanks to the breadth requirement. Those with demanding courses of study like pre-med might need to factor in the breadth requirement as first-years. And people who previously would have avoided talking about Latin honors might find themselves explaining their ambitions whenever course selection comes around.
Yet, graduating without honors won’t prevent anyone from finding a job or going to graduate school — it’s an academic achievement that provides recognition and little else.
I doubt any of these shifts will happen overnight. Instead, I’m worried about Amherst 10 years in the future, when no student remembers the college prior to the breadth requirements. Will students actually be more intellectually curious? Will first-years announce to their friends that they want to graduate summa cum laude? Will we still boast to prospective students that we have an open curriculum?"
2023-02-15,Under the Rubble: A Tragedy Reveals Cultural Bias,"
“Should we consider the deaths of 40,000 people a tragedy?”
If I were to pose this question to every member of the Amherst College community, I would be hard-pressed to find someone who answered in the negative. Yet this week, when 40,000 human beings died, this campus did not mourn or recognize their deaths. By and large, this campus did nothing to aid the global humanitarian effort to help ensure that this staggering number does not continue to grow. This campus was so unmoved by this devastating loss of human life that not even one collective thought or prayer was spared for the deceased and injured.
I am, of course, alluding to the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria that claimed the lives of at least 40,000, a number that will undoubtedly grow as more bodies are recovered and the victims succumb to their injuries.
There is a striking disconnect between this reality and the level of empathy felt at Amherst. With the exception of a brief mention in the weekly email from the Amherst Association of Students (AAS) reporting on the activity of the Budgetary Committee, there has not been a single public acknowledgement of the tragedy, event honoring the dead, formalized fundraising effort, or a Turkish or Syrian flag raised in solidarity since the earthquake struck last week. And while I don’t believe that activism via social media is always effective, it is an apt indicator of the stances that are perceived to be virtuous by the larger community at a given time. Even in this relatively trivial regard, Amherst has failed.
In the face of such a monumental calamity, the absence of basic human compassion displayed by the Amherst community is not simply benign apathy. It is a political statement that says that the lives lost were so meaningless that they do not even warrant a false show of compassion. Why these deaths in particular are of such little consequence to our community is not a mystery to anyone paying attention: The individuals affected were Muslim people of color. The Amherst community is not alone in this lack of compassion. The Western world is so desensitized to death and destruction in the Middle East that even such a tremendous disaster has barely captured its attention. (While Türkiye is not in the Middle East, the West does not make much of a distinction.)
It would be convenient to bring these charges only against the white community, but the truth is that leaders of student spaces intended for communities of color have been almost equally silent on the issue. With the exception of the the Middle Eastern North African Association (MENAA) and the Muslim Students Association (MSA), large and well-established affinity groups such as the Black Students Union (BSU), La Causa, and the Asian Students Association (ASA) have not bothered to hide their indifference to this tragedy.
It’s true that any formal response to the earthquake is outside of the scope of their respective missions. However, I believe that solidarity among communities of color is an ideal to which the Amherst community should aspire, and the lack of response in this situation is especially egregious given the magnitude of the disaster. Regardless, the silence from these communities will make any future plea for solidarity among communities of color or cross-cultural activism a bitter pill for me to swallow. Parenthetically, it should be noted that Syria and Türkiye are Asian countries, and so a response from the ASA is a reasonable expectation.
Others might retort that Amherst College has no control over natural disasters and very little ability to contribute to relief efforts beyond fundraising. So why does its response matter? A population’s response to a tragedy is indicative of its humanity. The lack of response to the fatalities and destruction has revealed a heartless, racist, and uncharitable Amherst community, which includes its students, faculty, and administration.
It’s difficult not to compare this callousness to the energy that brought the community together following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The myriad ways that Amherst united to express solidarity with Ukraine, in a situation they similarly had little control over, are too many to enumerate here. A few are worth mentioning, however: A letter from former President Biddy Martin was sent out to the Amherst community; a public statement was made on social media; a vigil was held for the victims of the war; the Mead Art Museum put together an impromptu exhibit; and panel discussions of the implications of the crisis were convened. The Amherst community rallied compassionately around the Ukrainian students on campus, recognizing the tangible ways that the tragedy was touching community members. More generally, there was a sense on campus that something bad was happening in the world, and that we ought to care.
None of the same can be said amid the crisis in Türkiye and Syria.
Of course, the comparison between the invasion of Ukraine and this earthquake is not perfect. The former is a geopolitical issue with consequences involving NATO and involves the perceived oppression of a group of people. The latter is a natural disaster without an instigator or clear military repercussions.
But the lack of complexity of an earthquake, the absence of sides to be taken, ought to make a compassionate response easier. In my view, it makes such a response all the more mandatory. Additionally, during any discussions of the war in Ukraine on campus, there was always a sense that the community was not only invested in the geopolitical consequences as an intellectual exercise; there was an intangible sense of empathy that accompanied these discussions. Such empathy is what is missing from campus in this critical moment.
But it would be unfair to say that the college doesn’t care about the suffering of Muslims and people of color at all. When their suffering upholds Western notions of female oppression and repressive Islamic regimes, Amherst is quick to voice its sympathy and draw attention to the topic. Such was the case last semester when nationwide protests erupted in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. Such a response was appropriate and well-executed on the part of the college.
But the fact that this event, which upholds Western ideas about the Middle East, garnered such a response throws into stark relief the lack of attention the earthquake and its aftermath have received. One shouldn't take it as a coincidence that this event, which can't be leveraged for these ends, has been ignored.
The college’s cold-hearted indifference to this disaster is not at all surprising. Nor will I demean myself by begging Amherst to act like it cares about the brown-skinned, Muslim lives lost — I know it does not. This past week has left me bitter and angry. And while this lack of response was expected, I am deeply disappointed in my friends, my professors, and my school administrators."
2023-02-15,ChatGPT’s Apocalypse Already Happened,"
Nearly every day since Christmas, I’ve received an email newsletter with a subject line consumed with techno-panic. The culprit this time? ChatGPT.
“How ChatGPT will destabilize white-collar work.”
“ChatGPT is AI’s ‘Jurassic Park’ Moment.”
“It’s easier than ever for students to cheat on that five-paragraph essay.”
Notably, the vast majority of these headlines foretell the disruptive impact of ChatGPT on productivity, speaking in the future tense about some doomsday for which all we can do is hold our breath and wait.
But the crisis is already here — in fact, it’s been a long time in the making.
Being born in 2002, I am part of a generation whose social development was hijacked by the smartphone. As online gathering spaces proliferated, the percentage of 8th graders who reported meeting up with their friends almost every day fell by about 40 percent from 2008 to 2016.
This figure comes from sociologist Jean M. Twenge’s widely-read 2017 cover story in The Atlantic that quantified the pervasiveness of smartphones for my generation and the corresponding impact on our mental health.
The advent of ChatGPT should alert us to an oft-overlooked aspect of the Twenge-pocalypse, and one that has been particularly consequential to my personal development. It is something that became clear to me during the first bleak winter of the Covid-19 pandemic.
It was Jan. 2021, and my overcast days at home in the Chicago suburbs were punctuated only by the icy chirps of lost cardinals and the Zoom-screen effigy of the bespectacled and effervescently animated Senior Lecturer in English Benigno Sanchez-Eppler. There were 40 of us enrolled in his 2021 J-term course, “Letter Writers and Epistolarity,” and probably fewer than 10 of us had ever written a letter more complex than some perfunctory thank-you note. But at our very first meeting, while we were distractedly texting and scrolling and commenting off-camera, Sanchez-Eppler interrupted with a warning:
“It is the act of writing about your life that creates experiences. And so, it’s possible to go your whole life without having a single experience — that is, if you don’t write.”
After a total of 180 hours of class meetings and hundreds of Gmail correspondences, I can confirm that the lost art of letter-writing enchanted those isolated days: I learned more about myself over that time than any other in my young adulthood. The process of writing letters bestows context and form on the ephemerality of consciousness; it is a careful process, a process of translating muddled moments into an intimate narrative, a suspended bit of space-time, for your recipient.
It is not just that smartphones have displaced our venues of socialization, but they have increasingly reduced the intentionality behind our daily communication — language is being brutally instrumentalized. As digital social platforms, aided by AI, have ascended to lord over our linguistic practices, they have threatened to make the writing process obsolete, according to the preliminary findings of American University Professor Emerita of Linguistics Naomi Baron.
In Baron’s upcoming book, titled “Who Wrote This? How AI and the Lure of Efficiency Threaten Human Writing,” she argues that ChatGPT is just the most recent invention in our quest to automate writing for the sake of productivity. Along the way, we have forgotten that writing is not just a commodity, but an everyday facilitator of thought.
In a 2015 BBC essay, URochester Professor of Technology Evan Selinger wrote about AI-driven predictive text as a harbinger of a world where people stop thinking about their words. Like Baron, the problem to Selinger wasn’t that writing would become more homogenous, per se.
“We’ve got spontaneous things to say that we never anticipated … [But] as communication becomes less of an intentional act, we give others more algorithm and less of ourselves.”
The techno-panic surrounding ChatGPT is misplaced. While we conjure dystopian futures of robotic journalism, AI-ghostwritten essays, and jobless communications professionals, the automation of writing has (and continues to) rob us of original thought.
Text-generative AI takes this automation to the next level — but this should not come as a surprise. In order to reclaim the true value in writing, we need to push against the ever-intensifying grain of profit-value and productivity, towards a world where we more intentionally outsource this process to machines.
Only then will we remember what it means to experience."
2023-02-15,To Honor the Open Curriculum,"
Last Tuesday, the Committee on Educational Policy passed a proposal to amend the college’s policy on Latin honors. Under the previous system, Latin honors were awarded based on class rank, as well as the relevant department’s assessment of the student’s thesis. The new policy maintains the thesis assessment, but now evaluates summa and magna honors based on median letter grades and whether a student has passed at least one course in each of four academic disciplines: arts, humanities, sciences and mathematics, and social and behavioral sciences. Students currently enrolled in the college are grandfathered into the old system, though. They will be evaluated with the system under which they would receive the highest honors, but all matriculating classes henceforth will receive honors under the new policy.
Although the Editorial Board approves of the elimination of class rank as a Latin honors consideration, as it alleviates student stress surrounding rigid grade cutoffs, we believe that the new breadth requirement is fundamentally harmful to the academic culture at Amherst. The breadth requirement’s call to exploration reflects the tensions between the open curriculum and the values of the liberal arts: While many students develop well-roundedness by exploring the curriculum, others use the freedom to specialize in the department of their expertise. The new policy intends to encourage a more explorative approach to the open curriculum rather than a path of specialization. While The Editorial Board affirms the value of an interdisciplinary education, we believe that the policy’s top-down prescription to encourage greater variety damages student curiosity and class dynamics and is ultimately at odds with the college’s institutional academic values — namely, freedom and student-directed exploration.
On one hand, the breadth requirement will impact the actual classroom experience. While it may seem fruitful up front — students will stretch themselves to discover passions that they may not have otherwise and departments will better be able to source students of different academic backgrounds — this requirement overlooks the power of the open curriculum to cultivate genuine curiosity and passion through choice. When students are given freedom, classes are more often composed of those who are present because they want to be there, regardless of whether they have to. With the policy in place, courses will become increasingly filled with students enrolled for the wrong reasons — box-checkers obligated rather than moved to explore. It stands to reason that such a shift in composition will alter the classroom dynamic, reducing the depth of learning due to a shallow motive for inquiry.
Moreover, the grade change would likely help students explore the open curriculum anyway without the college’s top-down breadth requirements. By reducing the pressure of class rank, students are encouraged to dabble outside of familiar terrain. This was the line of thinking responsible for the implementation of the Pass/Fail policy in 2021. Another alternative to administrative prescriptions for breadth may be to increase the number of interdisciplinary courses within departments. Regardless, a natural change to the college’s academic culture rather than top-down prescriptions, no matter how well-intentioned, must be put into effect.
But beyond how the changes will impact, on a tangible level, the academic Amherst experience, what’s just as important is what they mean for Amherst’s institutional identity. With the open curriculum, design-your-own-majors, and limited major requirements, Amherst has always been, in the eyes of the Editorial Board, defined by academic freedom and student-directed exploration. A decision made by the faculty — not the students themselves — to institute a breadth requirement, even if it won’t immediately drastically alter our experience, signals that the college is one degree less committed to the ideals with which it has become synonymous.
The Editorial Board appreciates the administration’s new emphasis on exploration and transparency in its consideration of a broader academic portfolio. However, education through administrative policy is counterproductive to the college’s vision for its curiosity-driven culture and learning environment. A policy-enforced education soon becomes a chore rather than a pursuit; it is precarious territory for the college to claim that it knows what is best for students without allowing them the room to come to such a conclusion themselves.
Unsigned editorials represent the views of the majority of the Editorial Board — (assenting: 11; dissenting: 9; abstaining: 2)."
2023-02-15,Val for Pal: How To Maintain Your Long-distance Friendship,"
As we grow older, we inevitably welcome sundry connections under different categories into our life. However, the people who we find it easy to stay close to are often those that have followed us since our early childhood. However, Amherst, in opening its doors to students from all corners of the world, has birthed new beginnings for international friendships. But how do we maintain these long-distance connections? During this time of the year, when one of the most wholesome holidays to celebrate friend love rolls around, it feels right for me to sit down and unfurl the efforts that have prevented me and my BFFs in Vietnam from being “out of mind” when we’re “out of sight.”

1. Remember Important Dates and Do Something Special for Them
It is an unspoken rule that our best friends should shower us with birthday wishes on the exact date, even when Facebook doesn’t send the reminder. For my group of five, we take turns spamming the group with all kinds of customized wishes. It went from sentimental text messages in the early years, to planned birthday videos full of improv footage, to pandemic-isolation styled celebrations with filter-laden Zoom calls. Have you ever typed “Happy Birthday” with your friend’s name or nickname next to it on Youtube? There’s a good chance you will find a funny video that celebrates the birthday of someone whose name matches your friend’s. Send the video at your discretion to your friend. I’m sure they will laugh for a really long time, and that’s the best sign of a good birthday one could ever have!
2. Engineer Nicknames That Keep the Spark Alive
When you’re far from home, you don’t get to form new spatial memories with your loved ones. A nickname is an integral part of long-distance relationships that tells your friends that you care about them and can relate to them from any visible dimension, often stemming from memorable events or observations of certain conspicuous traits of a person. Up your name game by changing the nicknames of the members on your messaging platform every six months. I often surprise my friends with new quirky names taken straight from my observation of their reactions during our most active discussions. For instance, a couple of months ago, I waited for the entire group to go to sleep in their local time zone, then surreptitiously nicknamed them after their boyfriends’ names. As soon as one messaged the group, others were alarmed because they thought the boys joined the group. That name change received quite a lot of positive feedback, unofficially filling the chat box with only the best vibes. A good nickname entails dedication, and it only matters that they get what you mean!
3. Treat it Like a Registered Student Organization: Don’t Flout Regular Meetings!
In comparison, a group of friends is not much different from a family-owned business, a church convent, or a membership-exclusive organization with a common cause: existing as living proof that long-term friendship is possible. With that being said, like any Registered Student Organizations (RSO)s on campus, we are also powered by regular online group meetings, and the recent one was an group-wide Uno tournament ight during Lunar New Year. I had the opportunity to do my favorite activity, that is, to send lucky money to my friends in Vietnam through Sendwave. Seeing them engage in the games and work their way to the prizes really warmed my heart in an indescribable way.
Love knows no distance. Although it’s a bummer that I was not yet back in Vietnam, I led the agenda for my friends’ New Year celebration. Researching meeting locations, menus, and prices that best cater to my friends’ funds gave me the most wholesome experience and helped me make positive contributions to my clique in the most creative way possible. It can be said that arranging the time to be fully present is a gift horse that connects us between two distant lands.
4. Virtual Game Nights Makes Distance a Vantage
One great thing coming out of being the one and only (hopefully) batch of young generation in Covid era is that, sometimes, being far away is a legit blessing in disguise. Virtual entertainment-wise, you can always rely on skribbl and Gartic Phone where you can play countries apart. You should also try out a Zoom version of Scavenger Hunt where everyone gets up and runs around the house trying to snatch all the items on the list in the shortest amount of time.

5. Design Your Group’s Social Media Purpose of Use
Instagram and Tiktok are particularly great for the most fashionable poses when traveling and viral trends to do with our best buddies, which you can definitely resonate with. In our case, we view our connectedness on these platforms as backup emergency cards. There are days when one of us just can’t help but want to lock ourselves from the outside world and deactivate one of our social media platforms. Finding alternative platforms helps us stay close and look out for each other during those trying times. There are days when we just decide to go professional and educational with the platforms: We edited our LinkedIn profiles and celebrated each other's studying more than 10 lessons or reaching a new league on Duolingo. Surely I don’t need to mention sending Instagram reels or sharing Facebook memes to the messenger group so you can all laugh off your life’s shared sufferings!

6. Changes Happen, but Nothing Will Change Our Friendship
It’s inevitable that as I leave my hometown for education, my mindset is bound to change. Faced with problems that triggered an existential crisis, caused me to cancel plans to fly home, and a million unfinished future plans, my tectonic plates were shaking because things wouldn’t turn out like what I wanted. It felt as if it was Judgement Day when our middle-school pact of “Forever Alone” and the plan of living together until old age was put on halt when my friends met the guys that made their hearts flutter. Friendship can make you feel possessive: There were times when I thought I was being left out, and it felt like our friendship was on the verge of falling apart. But I’m really grateful that we got a second chance, then a third chance, and many other chances to learn how we can cherish this kismet. I have come to realize that my place in their hearts remains unchanged. I was introduced to my friends’ new friends in college. Maybe these people have helped my friend through a tough time when I wasn’t around, and I really owe them a big hug.
7. As We Learn From Each Other, We Grow
Self-growth is the raison d’etre of all relationships, and friendship is the ne plus ultra (a.k.a best example you can have?) of this virtue when we get to improve together with our amigos. My group of friends is made up of five individuals with different personalities and as far as the “opposite attracts” tenet goes, our friendship only reached a new level when we came to appreciate each other’s unique beauties and learned to adopt these traits to create our most concrete first steps into the real world. On a more entertaining note, growth does not always have to be something that sounds life-changing. Try living the life of your friends by binge-watching a recommended list of Netflix series by them, or keeping yourself engrossed in a book that they keep rambling about. You may realize the values of life that your friend secretly embraces from their point of view.
Friendship takes time. Sometimes as a human that still needs to learn many things, I become impatient and annoyed because unpredictable outcomes of human relationships can still leave you at square one no matter how much effort you put in. In the highly commendable series “Lucifer,” Dr. Linda tells Mazikeen — the demon that follows Lucifer to Earth — as she explores the concept of friendship: “Emotions are hard, but they make you stronger.” We need friends to mollify the pressure that comes from the entities that we are chasing after and running away from. But when friends are the main reason why we feel hurt, we learn to take the problem into our own hands with a new kind of strength.
While at Amherst, I have met wonderful people whom I hope to call friends and get to know better for the rest of my life. It’s the friendship that I’ve kept with my friend group over the years that have allowed me to take on a glass-half-full approach that I can open myself up and face whatever comes. If you are reading this article with questions about friendship, I hope it brings you to the place closest to the answers you are looking for.

2023-02-08,The Market Logic of Mental Health,"
When I went through my first episode of anxiety, all I could think about was fixing myself. I was obsessed with the idea that something was wrong with me, and it was not until much later that I realized this feeling was what was keeping me stuck. Many people suffering from mental health crises share this problem of self-doubt and self-criticism, through which detrimental states of mind sustain themselves. But what is the root of such personal dissatisfaction? How does our discourse and narrative surrounding mental health contribute to this self-destructive frame of mind?
The stigma surrounding mental health crises is slowly fading. These days, mental health disorders are more often classified as biological or chemical conditions as opposed to personal failings. This shift represents society moving away from the idea that mental illness should be overcome through force of will and encourages attending to emotional problems instead of repressing them. Certainly our changing societal conceptions around mental health represents progress in some form, but the emerging narrative is not without its shortcomings.
Our new approach suggests that mental health crises are caused by an imbalance in brain chemistry and that they are in a sense incidental, implying that they are not caused by the sufferer’s actions. This narrative is designed in part to prevent people from blaming themselves for their mental health issues, but it nevertheless still frames a mental health crisis as a problem to be fixed. Approaching most emotional issues as nothing but impediments to our lives still leads to the self-criticism that is damaging and counter to a sense of well-being. To evaluate whether there is a better way to conceive of mental health problems that avoids this, let’s first take a look at how mental health crises work.
I can only speak to my experience with anxiety, but as I understand it, there are basic similarities between all anxious episodes, and there is considerable overlap with depression as well. The nature of an episode of anxiety or depression as I see it is the inability to control our emotions and recurring thought patterns. Someone who has not gone through a mental health crisis may wonder how thoughts and feelings could ever become uncontrollable, and the answer, quite simply, is habit. Thought loops don’t begin as debilitating, but if we circle within a particular train of thought, we cannot easily remember any other way to think after enough time has passed. At this point, it can become extremely hard to break the cycle of thoughts and feelings that feed on each other, and intensive therapy and medication is needed to retrain our brains.
The reason we get trapped in these cycles is fear. Fear acts as a trigger — when it arises, we spiral into unwanted thought loops as an automatic and misguided attempt to alleviate it. Clearly fear can come from any number of different places, but an almost universal source of fear is the notion that we are somehow not good enough — a thought intimately tied to societal expectations. This means the ethics of a society can have a direct impact on perpetuating mental health crises, and in the case of our society, the foremost social expectation is continual productivity in the market.
In America, most people only take their mental and emotional health seriously when it begins interfering with what is considered to be “valued work,” and our notion of value is conceived rather narrowly. “Hustle culture” defines grinding and economic success as paramount, and as such, the most productive activities are generally considered to be those that have a direct or indirect impact on our economic output. But this calls into question activities like exercising or socializing, which are considered productive even though they aren’t economically valuable at first glance. In general, activities considered to be “healthy,” like exercise, are seen as more productive than unhealthy ones, like watching TV. Regardless of the increasing weight put on “self-care,” it is still undoubtedly seen as secondary to one’s work and contribution to the economy.
This should not come as a surprise, but what is perhaps surprising is why healthy activities are seen as productive at all, although admittedly less so than work. In following market logic, we see that healthy activities are considered productive not because of any intrinsic value placed on health, but only because they ensure our continued ability to work. This has huge implications for our mental health.
In the event of a mental health crisis, we become essentially unable to focus on work. The common wisdom is that in order to feel better, it’s important to fill the void with other productive activities, such as socializing and exercising. These activities considerably improve peoples’ mood and outlook, with qualitative as well as quantitative evidence showing measured increases in serotonin and dopamine, neurotransmitters closely associated with mental well-being. While diet, exercise, sleep, and socializing undeniably help with mental health, they are not a silver bullet. Even with these strategies, many still feel overwhelmingly anxious and depressed, due in part, as previously discussed, to fear-induced cycles of self-critical thought. In fact, one reason why diet, exercise, and socializing are recommended is because they are known to improve self-image.
But very rarely does anyone ask why these activities make us feel good about ourselves. I would argue that in our society, it is not so much the intrinsic qualities of these activities that leads to self-confidence, but instead their connection to our ingrained market-based ethic. As I have shown, “healthy” activities are considered productive because they aid one’s ability to work, which must come first according to our society’s values. Because we are implanted with the idea that we are only valuable if we are working, it doesn’t make sense for doctors to ask people suffering from emotional problems to put health first and work second.
So, if pursuing healthy activities won’t help mental health, then what will? The answer is, increasingly, medication. Mental healthcare has become enfolded into the umbrella of Western medicine and is increasingly being addressed with diagnoses and medication, just like other health problems. This comes with some advantages, including a growing availability of treatment and a forthcoming social acceptance of it.
But framing emotional problems medically also comes with its own generally close-minded attitude and an unwillingness to acknowledge alternative treatments, such as talk therapy or other forms of holistic healing. Psychiatry, far from a holistic practice, has instead become cold and calculated; it’s an analytical science that identifies symptoms, classifies people into boxes, and prescribes medication designed to address those symptoms instead of trying to solve problems at their source. Psychological problems often have their root in a traumatic experience, unresolved fear, or a misunderstanding of one’s own feelings, and these issues cannot be resolved simply by addressing the anxiety or depression they may cause. In fact, even though the administration of psychiatric drugs has increased significantly over the last twenty years, the prevalence of mental health disorders has not.
As opposed to psychiatry, which involves scarcely more than taking a tiny pill each morning, talk therapy oftentimes requires intensely painful and prolonged emotional work. Therefore, when people weigh their options, committing to therapy understandably seems like an onerous prospect because of its high costs — many who want therapy are unable to afford it, and even for those who can, it represents a huge investment of time and attention.
This brings us back to the idea that in our society, productivity and mental well-being are at odds. Although therapy is designed to help us find the root of our problems and ultimately become happier and more fulfilled, it’s hard to be working a job when you must at the same time be doing the exhausting emotional labor that therapy entails. As a result, the system does not make room for it. In the mainstream, emotional growth is not a valued economic activity, and it is therefore highly preferable for people to use medication to curb emotional issues or to simply do nothing at all.
I am not advocating for the dismantling of the structures we have built to help people who are suffering from mental health crises. Psychiatry has its shortcomings, but its straightforward approach can nevertheless be a source of great comfort for people. For me, it was an immense relief to know that a licensed professional was addressing my issue using clinically proven methods, and that my condition was essentially guaranteed to improve. Up until I had sought psychiatric treatment, I was relying wholly on myself to fix what I had identified as an emergent fatal flaw, and psychiatry took some of the responsibility of “repairing” myself out of my hands. Since being on medication I’ve achieved more control over my mind, and as a result talk therapy has become an effective tool for making more holistic emotional progress. For this reason, psychiatry should be seen as just one of many useful tools in combating mental illness, as opposed to both the start and end of treatment.
However, it is evident that in order to truly improve our collective mental health, expectations about how to be a member of society must change. This goes deeper than just eliminating the stigma around mental health crises or medication. Even if people are becoming okay with the idea of being in a mental health crisis (due in part to the shift in narrative), they are still not okay with the consequences of it — the loss of conventional productivity. We must ease the expectation of universal and sustained economic productivity that drives people to hate themselves en masse. We need to change the way we define value. People must be made to feel okay with taking time for themselves and using time as they wish.
This means dismantling the idea of work as the end-all be-all of life. It may be a tired sentiment, but we should be working to live, not living to work.
In my own case, the pressure I put on myself to meet expectations was what fueled my mental health crisis. The event that initiated my anxious episode eventually became irrelevant, as the anxiety became entirely self-perpetuating — I was afraid of the fear itself, and stuck on the idea that the fear would keep me from ever being valuable again. It is far too easy for people to feel like they are broken in this world. The truth is that there is no way for a person to be broken — there is no wrong way for a person to be."
2023-02-08,Where Does Your Amherst Sweatshirt Come From?,"
While Amherst College students aren’t known for boisterous displays of school spirit, they do love to sport the Amherst logo. But where, specifically, do our branded clothing items come from, and are expressions of school spirit really contingent upon possessing material things? To explore these questions, in this article, I take a deep dive into the sourcing of Amherst merchandise.
Note: This project was inspired by “ENST/SOCI-226,” as well as a listing in the Office of Sustainability’s new Sustainability Projects Database.
Part 1: A Trip to Mammoth Market
Amherst’s A.J. Hastings store shut its doors recently after 108 years of business, and leftover merchandise was transferred to the Keefe Center’s Mammoth Market. I began my investigation there, by peeking at the labels of their stock. As expected, most were manufactured abroad in countries in the “Global South” like Honduras, Indonesia, and El Salvador. In addition to being sourced from overseas (i.e., expending exorbitant amounts of fuel), some of these products came from factories with documented human rights violations. The Gildan sweatshirt pictured below looks innocent enough, but human rights abuses have been recorded as recently as 2017 in Honduras’ Gildan factories. However, A.J. Hastings is no longer supplying Amherst’s branded clothing. So what’s next for Amherst’s branded merch?

Part 2: Partnership with Follett
According to Amherst’s website, the college is finalizing a deal with a company called Follett, which has culminated in a recently launched online marketplace.

Follett is an Illinois-based corporation that subsidizes vendors in order to supply products to institutions including colleges and universities. Their clothing-specific vendor is listed as Alta Gracia, a factory in the Dominican Republic.

My research into Alta Gracia originally yielded very promising results. It has been widely praised as a breakthrough in ethical garment manufacturing, boasting a lax work environment and pay three times the country’s minimum wage. The Huffington Post and PBS News Hour hailed it as proof that clothing producers can fairly compensate their workers and still be competitive in a global market. But when the pandemic hit, demand for college merchandise dropped, and with it, so did Alta Gracia’s employee wages. The company went out of business altogether in 2021. However, at the time of this article’s composition, the Follett website still listed Alta Gracia as their clothing vendor. This begs the question: How can a factory that shut its doors nearly two years ago supply Follett, and in turn, Amherst, with clothing?
Part 3: Internal Inquiries
The college’s director of sustainability, Weston Dripps, kindly looped me in with Joe Flueckiger, director of dining services. Flueckiger, in turn, posed my questions to Ralph Johnson, director of procurement and shared services. Johnson told me, “We were careful to research vendors and to partner with a supplier who is transparent and who does have programs rooted in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG).” He shared that Allmade, Bella & Canvas, and Gildan are Follett’s primary vendors now, and he passed along the request for Follett to update their website accordingly.
Part 4: The Myth of Green Consumerism
While partnering with a socially and environmentally conscious vendor is a plus, green consumerism (or consumption with the planet’s well-being in mind) is not a magical antidote for environmental and social crises. It doesn’t truly get at the root of the problem, because until robust labor laws and enforcement are the norms, sweatshops will continue to dominate the marketplace unchecked. Should the ebb and flow of the market dictate who can live with dignity, and should Alta Gracia be written in history as a radical experiment — when the idea of treating workers with respect isn’t revolutionary at all? In the end, because green consumerism is still consumerism, it amounts to fighting fire with fire, markets with markets. The solution is therefore not just to buy green things, but to buy less things.
Part 5: Call to Action
Amherst College should adopt a set of fair-trade and sustainability criteria for vendors from which they solicit products, taking into account factors such as how far the factory is from the market, as well as how the laborers are treated along the commodity chain. A good jumping-off point might be the sustainable procurement policy brainstormed by this year’s senior seminar, ENST-495. According to the Dec. 5 Office of Sustainability Newsletter, “The Environmental Studies Senior Seminar ENST-495 this fall took on a series of campus sustainability initiatives as part of the class. Projects included … a sustainable procurement policy.” Dripps told me that while the “policy has not been formally written or adopted yet,” “they are working on developing recommendations for what such a policy could include.” Susannah Auderset, a student who took ENST-495 and worked on this project, said over email that they were “focused on a general procurement policy, while looking specifically at cleaning supplies.” Finalizing and expanding upon this body of work, as well as adopting it as an institution, would be a step in the right direction."
2023-02-08,The AAS Is Changing for the Better — Will Students?,"
To say that the topic of the Association of Amherst Students (AAS) Senate was contentious among students last semester would be something of an understatement. Between rising discontent among students over budgeting issues, a controversial vice presidential election, and a sensationalized impeachment trial, the rift between Amherst students and their government has significantly widened. As we transition into a new semester, the Editorial Board hopes that this year will serve as a fresh start for a stronger, more trusting relationship between students and the AAS.
In order for this to work, however, both non-AAS and the AAS to put effort into mending this stressed relationship. The entire Amherst community, not either party alone, is responsible for the discord.
Student engagement with the AAS beyond seeking funding from the Budgetary Committee (BC) is practically nonexistent. Just look at our voter turnout for elections (maybe a quarter of the student body, on a good year), or the number of people who show up to public comments during meetings (usually zero). There’s a reason why many Senate races are uncontested — most students have little to no interaction with, or interest in, our student government. The impeachment trial was likely the most engaged the student body has been with the AAS in recorded memory.
We complain and complain about how ineffective the AAS is as an institution, but how is the Senate supposed to represent the student body if the student body doesn’t tell them what it wants?
At the same time, the AAS certainly has its own share of the blame for the state of relations between itself and the rest of the student body. Many students feel that the AAS doesn’t have enough transparency or accountability regarding its work. In the past, senators concocted expensive Senate projects, presumably for the good of the Amherst community, yet rarely consulted with students about what these projects were actually trying to accomplish.
The BC, the most community-facing AAS committee, is perhaps the most frequent subject of student ire. Some students object to a perceived lack of clarity and transparency with regard to funding decisions, and disappointment with the ongoing budget crisis.
The missing ingredient for engagement is a collective lack of understanding on students’ part of what the AAS does and what they have power to do. Without feedback, students can't hold the AAS accountable, causing it to function more as a club than a representative body. At the same time, the lack of clear and consistent communication between the AAS and students leaves it ambiguous what, exactly, students should be expecting from the body.
To their credit, the AAS has already begun making necessary changes that will change this relationship for the better, such as its newest Committee on Public Relations, which aims to increase engagement with the student body and give more publicity to senate projects. This committee would do well to enact several student-facing policies all at once, such as a question box where students can submit comments and concerns, as well as polls to gauge what on-campus issues students are most concerned about. Now, it’s time for us students to do our parts and actually be involved in the democratic process. We need to remember that AAS Senators don’t just represent us, but are also students, just like us: the same people we go to class with, eat at Val with, and see around campus.
Undeniably, there are many more complexities in the relationship between the Senate and the student body. The intensification of budget constraints, the administration’s poor communication with the AAS, the increasing discontent with the AAS’s constitution (time for a constitutional convention, maybe?): All of these factors have added their own challenges to the situation.
Though we can’t understand the specific challenges that the AAS faces, The Student, perhaps more than any other organization on campus, understands firsthand the challenge of representing the student body, and the potential pitfalls of being a separate organization, isolated from the rest of campus. Our critique of the sensationalization of the trial is particularly ironic, considering how our coverage of the event contributed to it — our article about the impeachment trial was among our most-clicked articles last semester.
Despite the drama of the night, the impeachment trial had an unexpected positive outcome: It showed the capacity of the AAS to be organized and carry out proceedings, of senators to be passionate about their love for Amherst and the AAS, and for students to be engaged. It is this passion and engagement from non-AAS students, AAS representatives, and other community members that will make Amherst a better place for all of us.

2022-12-07,Exit Letter: An Unforgettable Journey,"
My journey with The Student began, fittingly, with an issue published by The Student.

It was May 2020, the end of my freshman year, and two and a half months after the pandemic had dispersed Amherst students across the world to continue their learning remotely. As the national news reported on a seemingly non-stop barrage of suffering, loss, and injustice, The Student published its annual Commencement issue, highlighting the stories and accomplishments of 13 graduating seniors who had left their mark on the college, even as they had to navigate a final semester that nothing could have prepared them for.

Having just finished a semester that left me with a profound sense of helplessness, and a year that left me feeling lost, unfulfilled, and altogether unsure of what I was supposed to be doing with my time at Amherst, I read those profiles with great attentiveness, hoping to find some sort of guidance or inspiration — anything that might help me also make my college career a meaningful one.

Among the different places where the seniors had made their mark — the Association of Amherst Students, affinity groups, resource centers — one stood out in particular. In editors-in-chief emerita Shawna Chen’s ’20 and Emma Swislow’s ’20 profiles, they recounted the intense, fun-filled, and intimate community that was The Student’s newsroom. The image of a tight-knit group of students all investing themselves in a single project and supporting each other in the process stirred something in me, and I decided then that I would join The Student.

Yet, despite my sudden resolve, I didn’t really have any idea of what I wanted to do on the paper. When my sophomore fall rolled around and I was filling out The Student’s interest form, I haphazardly checked off a bunch of things that sounded interesting — arts writing, design, those seem cool; opinions writing, maybe; definitely not news writing, that’s boring. Perhaps it was another stroke of fate, then, that left me determined to write for the news section after I attended The Student’s intro meeting, drawn by then-news editors Ryan Yu’s ’22 and Zach Jonas’ ’22 pitch of it as an immersive way to get to know and engage with the larger community.

That first semester was characterized by a sense of novelty, as, even though I wouldn’t really experience that initial draw of newsroom community until I joined the editorial board the following semester, I discovered the different things I enjoyed about writing for the paper: the hands-on learning, the satisfaction of getting published, the unique connection of interviewing (even when it was happening over Zoom). In a semester that took place within the continuing anguish and oppression of the pandemic, when the discussions in my Zoom classes and the mountain of readings, problem sets, and essays that came with them felt hopelessly detached from anything that really mattered, The Student seemed to offer an opportunity to do something of real consequence, even if its scope was limited to the Amherst community.

I felt this sentiment most acutely when, by then an assistant news editor for the paper, I covered the campus response to the Atlanta spa shootings the following spring. Although it was emotionally draining to have to tune into the reactions and experiences of Asian students during the interview process and again during the writing process, it was also invigorating in a way. By writing the article, I felt that I was able to channel my own grief into something that could potentially have an impact on the community — something that might just mean something to someone.

Certainly there are limits to what the news can do on its own in simply bringing attention to issues. But I came to see this as, at least, a necessary first step to change; in particular, I came to believe in the power of stories to foster a shared understanding, to allow us to see beyond each of our limited perspectives and come together as a community.

At the same time, my love for working on the paper was only deepening from being on The Student’s editorial board. I feel so lucky to have been able to work with Zach and Sophie Wolmer ’23 to run the news section that first semester I became an editor. Looking back now, I marvel at the sense of teamwork we were able to have in our little section, even as we spent most production nights working from our respective dorm rooms and communicating only over text. Having people to share in, among other things, the excitement over the latest news and the accomplishment of finishing everything for the night made the weekly grind not just manageable, but something to look forward to.

Thus, when my editors-in-chief, Ryan and Becca Picciotto ’22, offered me the editor-in-chief position last fall, I knew deep down I wouldn’t say no. That isn’t to say I didn’t have very real reservations about the consistency and stamina required for the position. As that fall semester went on, I watched as Ryan and Becca took on the Herculean task of restarting the in-person newsroom after three semesters remote, which included having to reestablish nearly from scratch the processes and routines of putting together our print issue. On the other side of the lively and chaotic fun that characterized the earlier parts of their production nights were the long stretches into the deep and dreary hours of the night, which often came with crises that would pop up during one of those late hours and require a last-minute scramble to address.

When I stepped into the editor-in-chief position this past spring, I naively believed I would be able to immediately reform our weekly production timeline and avoid the long nights (and early mornings) I saw my editors-in-chief suffer through. But, as with many things that Covid has affected, the newsroom was not going to recover from the pandemic in just one semester. With the departure of our most senior editors at the end of the fall semester, the gap in recruiting and retention from the previous remote year now left us with leadership breaks in key sections, disrupting the mentorship process the paper so crucially depends on. Production nights began to regularly drag longer than even the worst nights of the previous semester. There has been many a Wednesday morning when my mental checklist of tasks left to do was so interminable that every minute had to be carefully budgeted just to make our 9 a.m. print deadline.

It has become somewhat of a tradition for these exit letters to address the question many have when they hear of how grueling this position is: “Why do you do this to yourself?” Certainly, there is not just one answer and sometimes there isn’t really any answer at all. If I had to give an answer now, though, I think it would lie in the deep responsibility that The Student has to our community. I will admit that I am kept up on Tuesday nights in part because of a case of perfectionism that often has trouble letting go of even the smallest inconsistencies. But what weighs most heavily on me has always been the pressure of making sure our stories are as solid as they can be before they go out. As a campus publication, The Student tells stories that no one else is going to tell, and with that comes an even greater need to get them right.

And it’s not just each individual article we publish, but also the story of the college that we tell with our publication as a whole. How can we tell a more complete and comprehensive story that includes the efforts and experiences of all the different groups and departments that make up the college community? What are the stories that we’ve told before, and the ones that we leave out? I’m so proud of and grateful to all our staff who have dedicated their time this past year to engage with these questions and to continue to push the paper forward, even amid the challenges and the other commitments we all juggle.

Indeed, there is much to celebrate. This semester, under the leadership of former news editors Caelen McQuilkin ’24E, Sonia Chajet Wides ’25, and Eleanor Walsh ’25, we brought our features section back from a 19-year hiatus — an effort that was also made possible by the diligence of Leo Kamin ’25, Ethan Foster ’25, and Michael Mason ’25 in taking over and carrying on our news section. Our articles are now often accompanied by stunning graphics courtesy of Nina Aagaard ’26. Our design editor Brianne LaBare ’25 has worked tirelessly to streamline our layout process. Thanks to her and the collective effort of our editors to shift back our editing timeline, production has been ending earlier, finally hitting a few weeks ago the 3 a.m. target I had set before my tenure began (a big improvement from the spring, when the free space on our newsroom bingo board was “Lynn stays up past 8 a.m.”). And this is not to mention the work that every section has done to expand in the past year, and the conversations that take place every week about how we can best serve our community.

Of course, The Student still has much it can improve on, and it always will. I am confident that this work will continue under the next editors-in-chief, Sam Spratford ’24 and Liam Archacki ’24, who will be stepping into my position starting next semester.

As I sit outside our Morrow basement office writing this exit letter on my last production night, though, it is not really all of this that is at the forefront of my mind, but rather the very thing that led me to join The Student in the first place. Listening to the familiar chatter emanating from the newsroom (interspersed with bursts of laughter and the occasional groan of frustration), I can’t imagine what my Tuesday nights next semester will be like without it.

To all the editors I’ve worked with in my tenure as editor-in-chief, thank you for everything. As many an editor-in-chief has said before, it really is the people that make The Student a truly unforgettable experience."
2022-12-07,Exit Letter: Theo Says Thank You,"
On March 9, 2020, I received two of the most significant emails I’ve opened during my time at Amherst. Other members of the Class of 2023 probably remember the first as clearly as I do: a 641-word blast which announced that, in response to the global spread of Covid-19, students were expected to leave campus over the next week and begin remote learning for an unclear duration. The second, which by the time I’d read the first seemed almost minor in comparison, was an invitation by then-Arts & Living editor Seoyeon Kim ’21 to take an editing test for the Arts & Living section. Now, however, with the clarity of nearly three years of hindsight, that second email seems like it ushered in just as tectonic a change.
In the months prior to those two emails, I’d started experimenting with writing for The Student. The topics ranged from my musical interests (as in a review celebrating the 25th anniversary of a favorite Oasis album which the Arts & Living section was kind enough to publish even though that anniversary had passed months prior) to my cinematic interests (like my review of “Watchmen”). These forays into writing had made me interested enough in the paper to apply for a position as an A&L editor. But, ironically, it was only after moving off of campus that I began to fully appreciate The Student’s ability to enhance the campus community. It helped that I was by then a new assistant A&L editor, clicking into editorial meetings every Sunday to hear from editors across all sections about pressing news and week-to-week concerns of students. What really made the difference, though, was the weirdness of life off-campus, as I kept close with friends but felt helplessly adrift from any sense of “Amherst” as a whole. The Student provided a space where the concerns and interests of the college community could still be voiced, representing a unique type of togetherness in a turbulent period.
I took the next year off of Amherst, not wanting to use up another block of credits on remote classes, but I kept working for The Student, driven in part by my experiences of the paper as a vital source of community connecting students on and off-campus. At that point, along with Lauren Kisare ’22, I was one of two editors at the head of the A&L section, and some of my proudest memories at the paper will always be the steps we took to keep the section running during that bizarre period — The Student’s first entirely remote year. These steps included hosting biweekly workshops for writers to learn about the section and discuss each other’s articles, piecing together a writing schedule to spread work equitably across staff writers, and just reading through submissions and (hopefully) providing thoughtful feedback.
Last year, The Student returned to operating fully in-person. Lauren left to study abroad, while Alex Brandfonbrener ’23 and Brooke Hoffman ’23E became my new section co-editors. The return to campus brought all sorts of challenges in and of itself. The Student returned to a weekly paper format with very little institutional memory, which meant learning and re-learning how to get the paper into print on a reasonable weekly schedule.
I’ve emphasized how much The Student functioned as a bastion of community while being on campus was impossible. But while the experience of learning remotely from all corners of the world is now a remote memory (or not a memory at all!) for most of us, I still constantly see ways that The Student enhances the campus community, especially since becoming a senior managing editor last spring, a position that has meant working with each of the paper’s sections. Sometimes, this takes the form of activism and calls to action for the school, like last semester’s “Better Amherst” series, which made the case for the necessity of offering more service-oriented learning at the college. Of course, it also means accurately communicating the details of breaking news. Frequently, it means reminding us that the campus community is so much larger than is suggested by the tunnel vision that students can so easily slip into as we move back and forth between classes with our peers and meals with our friends — this week’s article on the impact of dorm damage on college custodians is a great example.
Last but not least, I want to thank the many people who have helped make the newsroom such a rewarding place to work, even when — on nights like tonight — I’m here at 4:00 a.m. poring over line edits (or trying to write an exit letter), falling further and further behind on classwork, and mentally preparing myself to ask my professors for a new array of extensions.
There are too many names to name. I will miss working with the whole editorial board — and I will especially miss all the moments of laughing and not-quite-working.. I can’t extend enough gratitude to the other members of this year's leadership team, Editor-in-Chief Lynn Lee ’23 and Senior Managing Editor Liam Archacki ’24, who have put literally countless hours into helping this paper maintain its exceptional journalistic standards and steering it from strength to strength. Lynn, thanks for your stalwart and thoughtful leadership, and for your tireless commitment to the paper. Liam, thanks for being the best co-senior-managing-editor I could’ve asked for, and I can’t wait to see what you and Sam (Spratford ’24) achieve as EICs next semester. And thank you finally to my A&L co-editors over the years. Lauren, thanks for your mentorship and advice — it basically taught me how to be an editor. Alex, thanks for spending so many nights on InDesign duty, and for all the laughs along the way. Brooke, thanks for thinking up some of the best titles to ever grace The Student’s pages. I’ll always appreciate the friendships I’ve made and the moments I’ve experienced working here, alongside so many other students dedicated to thinking and writing critically in service of the campus community."
2022-12-07,Where Was the Constitution in the Impeachment Trial?,"
The Association of Amherst Students’ (AAS’s) troubled semester came to a cataclysmic finale on Monday with the impeachment trial of President Sirus Wheaton. Although the arguments of Petitioner Ankit Sayed and President Wheaton proceeded largely without incident (with the exception of a single heckler interjecting at the end of Sayed’s opening remarks), the Senate’s deliberations were sufficiently unprincipled to render the trial an entertaining, yet Constitutionally bankrupt, dumpster fire. The deliberations opened with attacks on Sayed’s character more fitting for gossip circles than a legislative body, and did not improve much from there. Indeed, it seemed of more concern to the Senate that Sayed may not love the AAS as much as he professed or may somehow stand to benefit personally from an impeachment than the possibility that Wheaton may have grossly neglected his constitutional duties and committed malfeasance.
A particularly disturbing point of the deliberations were the remarks by one Senator about potential instances of sexual harassment unearthed during former AAS Vice-President Jaden Richards’ testimony. The Senator, in a confounding twist of logic, suggested by implication that the presence of potential sexual harassment should be a reason for acquittal rather than impeachment. They reasoned that Sayed was using claims of sexual harassment for “political” benefit solely on the grounds that he had failed to elaborate on them outside of Richards’ examination. That the allegations were unearthed in the midst of unscripted testimony, the contents of which Sayed might not have known beforehand, was not considered by the Senator. More disturbingly still, the Senator’s remarks were met with approving finger-snaps from other Senators and members of the audience — clearly the view that sexual harassment allegations should be kept firmly under wraps in lieu of overwhelming evidence is not uncommon in the AAS.
I do not mean to suggest that President Wheaton had indeed committed sexual harassment. Richards’ testimony referenced only a single half-remembered and possibly consensual incident that the Senate could have reasonably given little to no weight as admissible evidence, although it nonetheless merited more debate than the Senate conducted considering that they did not discuss the incident much further after these remarks. But to wield a sexual misconduct claim against the party bringing it is a deeply troubling act, and one the Senate should be ashamed to have engaged in.
The Constitution received little notice from the Senate. The refreshingly sane and poignant arguments of Senator Henry Pallesen ’25 were one of the few times that the enumerated Constitutional duties of the President — the very duties that the gross negligence claims of the impeachment case were centered around — received any direct reference by the Senate (while other senators had hinted at the duties, they minimized the issues at play by treating them as a nebulous body of norms; Senator Pallesen’s arguments differed in that he quoted the Constitution directly and explicitly referred to its mandates). It would likely surprise the vast majority of Senators to learn that Section B of the Executive Branch section of the AAS Constitution outlines seven duties that the president is obligated to perform. In this section, the Constitution demands that the president shall:
It was uncontested at trial that President Wheaton failed to chair Executive Branch meetings and did not set any of their agendas for at least the majority of the semester. It was further uncontested that Wheaton did not serve in his ex-officio role on the College Council, has yet to call an all-campus meeting, and failed to present a speech at the first Senate meeting of the semester. Only in the case of his role on the College Council did Wheaton offer anything approaching a convincing excuse for his failure to perform. Furthermore, Petitioner Sayed alleged that Wheaton failed to live up to his duty to serve as the representative and spokesperson of AAS and the Student Body, and that his use of veto power was not accompanied by purportedly necessary explanations of his decisions to the Senate, although Wheaton contested both points. Even disregarding the Presidential duty to call an all-campus meeting (as it can be performed at any point during the year), three Constitutional duties remained clearly neglected, one (College Council) was unperformed and potentially neglected, and a further two were either wholly unmet or poorly met, depending on whether one accepts Sayed or Wheaton’s arguments. Not so much as one of these Constitutional duties did Wheaton clearly perform to the extent required of him.
Yet this was evidently of little matter to the Senate. One Senator readily brushed aside the duty to chair Executive Branch meetings as “just two or three text messages a week” which could be easily performed by the Vice-President anyways. This Senator’s cavalier attitude towards the Vice-President’s workload aside, characterizing these responsibilities as a handful of text messages was a severe understatement of Wheaton’s unmet duties, particularly considering that the President is also required to set those meetings’ agendas, a fact overlooked by the Senate until Senator Pallesen’s remarks as the second-to-last speaker before voting commenced. Certain senators were also all-too-willing to accept the argument that the failure of previous presidents to present speeches at the Senate’s first semesterly meetings justified Wheaton’s failure to do the same. The Senate apparently accepted on its face Wheaton’s excuse for not attending College Council meetings — that he had been left off of email chains — with little of the debate as to officials’ obligations to be proactive in performing their duties that it deserved. Combined, these individual shortcomings seemingly constituted widespread and gross negligence encompassing the entirety of Wheaton’s Section B Constitutional duties. Perhaps I am wrong — I will admit that I could be convinced otherwise in a well reasoned and factually grounded debate. But as it stands, the Senate’s ineptitude deprived the student body of such discourse, as Senators saw fit to treat Wheaton’s constitutional non-performances as nothing more than isolated aberrations to be cursorily dismissed.
Although I disagree with the Senate’s verdict, my primary issue and the focus of this article remains the disgraceful failure of the Senate to appropriately weigh the evidence before them in light of the Constitution’s mandates in their deliberations. Unfortunately, these failures extended to the Senate’s debates over the impact of their decision on the future of the AAS. The Senate was deeply concerned by the precedent that would be set by an impeachment of President Wheaton. They fretted that it would “lower the bar” too much, allowing future officials to be impeached for extremely mild infractions of the Constitution and bylaws. Given that the trial itself was the first (and hopefully last) of its kind, such debate was not wholly unmerited. Yet the Senate, for all its fears of bar-lowering, did not consider at all the precedent that their acquittal would set. The acquittal established that an official, who had indisputably failed to perform several of their Constitutional duties and arguably neglected every single one of them, had not committed gross negligence. And likewise the official, having badgered some of their peers to the point of resignation, was also innocent of malfeasance. But perhaps it is telling that the Senate sees nothing wrong with officials berating each other while ignoring their constitutional duties.

2022-12-07,Experiencing Ableism in Amherst’s Infrastructure,"
When I first came to Amherst this August, I was quickly submerged in the high-energy culture of orientation — the commotion, the activities, and the glee palpable in the late summer air. However, despite my excitement to be on campus and to be engulfed within its vibrant culture, there was something I quickly realized: Getting around campus could be exhausting.
The seemingly endless, sloping hills wore me out as I tried to keep up with the ambitious orientation schedule, jam-packed with countless activities under the sweltering sun. I found myself exhausted by the end of the day, my head spinning with new names and faces, and my legs groaning from running up that hill (without the glamor of a Kate Bush song.) As a person with chronic leg pain, the briefest walks feel infinitely longer during flare-ups, and since orientation I’ve sometimes had to limp while going from one building to another.
This campus, from my initial observations, seemed anything but accessible.
The many hills on the campus pose a challenge for students who have high blood pressure, asthma, chronic pain, or use a mobility device. Furthermore, many of the buildings on campus are very old, meaning they do not have to follow the requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which states that all buildings for public use must be “designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992.” The far distance between some buildings on campus can also exacerbate existing issues, especially for new students unfamiliar with the campus layout.
Founded in response to these issues — and issues of accessibility for non-physical disabilities — the Disability and Neurodivergence Alliance (the DNA) is a student group that aims to acts as a site of community for disabled students, but also raises awareness towards existing accommodations that students can request, and works to establish positive relationships with faculty in pursuit of a more accessible campus. I learned about the group over the summer before I came to Amherst, and quickly became involved due to my passion for disability justice.
When I finally arrived, I was curious about the perspective of physically disabled students who have been at the school for years, and have had to deal with the mundane challenges of an inaccessibly-designed campus. I believe that the most well-versed in the disabled student experience are disabled students themselves, who have had to deal with the mundane challenges of an inaccessibly designed campus year after year. Their experiences on campus serve as testimony for the reality of Amherst College life.
Sam Hodges ’23, who serves as publicity director for the DNA, and also uses a cane and experiences joint pain, discussed the challenges of using elevators to get to classes.
Elevators “add a new level of complexity,” as Hodges says they are often tucked away in inconvenient locations. Many buildings don’t have directions for elevators, and the Keefe and Science Center elevators are especially slow. Floor plans are confusing and unclear, making it difficult for laypeople to determine what is an elevator versus an elevator storage area, further complicating an already difficult process. In some places, like the Loeb Center, the accessible entrance does not connect to an elevator that is student accessible.
To determine what is accessible, the campus utilizes a rubric for its campus map, available on the college website. Certain walkways cannot be designated as accessible due to the grade of their slope — a crucial challenge for the “college on the hill.” Pedestrian safety is another major concern, and an administrative priority. In my email exchange with director of accessibility strategy and resources Jodi Foley, she noted that “We carefully consider each recommended path based on safety first and convenience second.” Foley mentioned the college’s Facilities Accessibility Study Executive Summary, which outlines the college’s broader plans for increasing accessibility following its recently completed physical accessibility assessment, which “provided Amherst College with a blueprint for enhancing physical accessibility on campus.”
Many college buildings are exempt from modern accessibility policy under the ADA due to their age. The college is aware of this issue — its most recent Facilities Accessibility Study Executive Summary from 2019 specifically notes its aim to “expedite improvements to those facilities constructed prior to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990 that have not undergone major renovations since” (a category that includes many of the buildings on our nearly two-hundred-year-old, topographically unique, campus). But as Hodges lamented, “Do we have to rely on ADA technicalities?”
Book & Plow Farm and the Powerhouse have posed major challenges for Hodges, in terms of accessibility, due to their location. This is a troubling observation, considering the numerous campus social events hosted at these venues, making it more difficult for disabled students to engage with the community.
Tora Koh ’23, a senior with asthma and blood pressure issues, talked about how they struggled with the campus’ layout even before beginning their official tenure as an Amherst student. They participated in the Summer Bridge program as an incoming freshman, where they lived in Hitchcock Dormitory in the triangle and had a class in Webster Hall near Memorial Hill. They recounted struggling daily in a new environment with sleep deprivation, sunburn, and the aggressive summer heat, problems all exacerbated by their long walk to classes.
Since then, Koh’s challenges have continued. While they have been able to choose their classes in a way that maximizes ease, they haven’t been able to participate as fully in non-academic life. They need to be especially motivated to go to events hosted on the First Year Quad, and Johnson Chapel is out of the question due to its distance. In our conversation, they mentioned Mead Art Museum, saying: “It’s a super neat place and I would highly recommend it … I just can’t.” The administration has implemented a program called Mammoth Rides, an ACPD-run service to drive students around campus. Having used Mammoth Rides in the post, Hodges has voiced their concerns about the service – noting that it’s been difficult to identify which cars are the ACPD cars, and that students have had to wait outside in inclement weather.
Koh explained having to engage in a continual mental calculus to determine what Amherst activities they can participate in. This is the reason they live in Moore dormitory, to remain close to their many classes in the Science Center. “I’ve specifically had to go out of my way to position myself so that I’m not inconvenienced,” they said. With their singing lessons in the Arms Music Center, Koh has to walk up three flights of stairs and wait outside a classroom without benches.
Student experience like this shows the difficulties that all differently-constructed buildings on campus can pose. However, the facilities accessibility report notes that “the practicalities of funding and project management capacity dictate a phased approach” and so in improving accessibility in buildings on campus, they will prioritize “buildings that have not undergone major renovations since 1990 and that host unique programs or services not offered elsewhere on campus.”
Charlie Niedert ’25E, treasurer and social chair of the DNA, uses a wheelchair, and has faced issues with campus inaccessibility even before being physically present on campus. He informed Amherst of his disability after his initial acceptance and faced hostility from the administration.
Niedert said that “I have been told explicitly that this place was not meant for me …When I started my time here, I was very forcibly suggested to not come to campus and wait until I was healthier.” He explained that the infrastructure rendered the campus inaccessible for him, and that the systems in place have reinforced existing limitations.
Although Niedert was thankfully able to attend Amherst, he struggled with the lack of a disability community on campus in 2019 after his battle with obtaining accommodations. He expressed gratitude for the creation of the DNA. He said, “We have all these resource centers for so many different identities and marginalizations and yet there’s nothing really for disabled students, so I think that having [the DNA] will be beneficial.” The DNA is unique in that it’s grounded by lived student experience, a place in which the messy realities of disabled student life are mutually understood by all.
In his day-to-day life, Niedert noted, “going downhill is great, going uphill is not so great,” and cited his main obstacle as being slow elevators. He’s also had issues going to the Health Center, as people often park in a way that blocks the disabled entrance. This blocking of the accessible entrance was a constant before Covid. He has encountered barriers when trying to access campus resources, saying that there are “academic resources [he] simply cannot physically get to.”
The college’s report notes that as new renovation and construction projects begin, “the college intends to convene ad hoc committees of campus stakeholders to review the designs and provide essential practical insights regarding accessibility that will complement our compliance with applicable building codes.”
Niedert noted how intentional these efforts need to be. “Including disabled people requires a lot of active effort and change in infrastructure, and administrative and even teaching approaches. And I think they [the administration] prioritize[s] the idea of prestige and rigor over the inclusion of disabled people.”
For the future of accessibility at Amherst, I believe the most important principle to follow is the evergreen slogan used in the 20th century disability rights movement — “nothing about us without us.” When designing accessibility policy, disabled people must be at the forefront and present in all places where decisions are made.
In Amherst’s continuous quest for excellence, we cannot abandon disabled students. If we want to be a truly diverse, welcoming community, we have to interrogate all of campus life — including the very ground beneath our feet.

2022-12-07,In Praise of the Jones Library,"
Among the many resources our Valley offers, it has always surprised me to see how few Amherst students were members of the Jones Library. Of course, many of you readers may already be familiar with this endearing institution that graces our small town. However, for the newcomers, the skeptics, or the busy, I’d like to share some of the many reasons why I find the Jones so precious.
In front of Amherst Coffee and Amherst Cinemas, two equally important centers of the town’s intelligentsia, stands the main building of our small library system. An historic edifice from the 1920’s, it welcomes visitors with a New-England style carved pineapple as a symbol of hospitality. And indeed, friendly people work there. The whole place has been designed with the aim of making you feel at home: carpets, sofas, pillows, and even a fireplace make the library warm and comfortable. It’s a convenient shelter for the rainy days, a refuge when things go wrong, and a cozy cocoon when you need to rest. Surrounded by amazing books, you can spend hours of joyous reading there, till you forget all your troubles. Of course, you can also study, if you really want to: you’ll find quiet study rooms in the back of the building. However, I would suggest keeping the library immune from any boring task and heavy workload. This ain’t a prison; it’s a palace.
Let us compare mythologies: Frost has its catacombs, its offices and its long tables. You’re deemed to silence as soon as you enter. Even now that the “cafe” has reopened and you can access the terrace, this likely ain’t exactly your favorite place in the whole wide world. Better go to The Black Sheep, right? On the other hand, you’ve got Jones and its garden, its living room and its press corner, all filled with singing toddlers, role-playing teens, ukulele concerts, painting exhibitions and book-clubs. Needless to say, when I told people, “I’m going to the library”, only seldom did I refer to Frost.
As a foreigner, I was very curious about the cultural activities that took place in the United-States. Libraries in America appeared to me as real centers of civic life. I’ve visited many during my travels, since they can teach you a good deal about the place you’re in (my favorite is Baltimore’s Enoch Pratt Free Library, which is both magnificent and welcoming). In Brooklyn, I even experienced libraries as potential shelters, after I had the brave and foolish idea to have a quick dip into the ocean... during Thanksgiving break. Thank God the Brooklyn Public Library system is so extended they had an open branch right by Coney Island. Believe me, I’ve never been so happy to find a library by the beach! As I was slowly getting warm again, I came to understand the tremendous importance of libraries as tools for the common good, beyond their already magnificent role as temples of knowledge and relaxing reading rooms. Not only did the heated room save me from the terrible cold of the Atlantic, but it proved a wonderful resource for all kinds of people. I’ve witnessed Russian families trying to pass on their language to their little kids. I’ve seen old folks find a sense of belonging and connection, chatting with librarians. I’ve seen locals spending an instructive hour reading the news. I’ve seen people creating community.
In truth, being a member of the Amherst library system provides you with a real connection with the town. Not only will you be able to attend numerous events, but you can learn about our small town and engage with its citizens. Jones is a collection point for the Amherst Survival Center's Food Drive and it hosts ESL and citizenship programs. If you’re an American citizen, you can even volunteer to help immigrants become a part of this country. The Jones definitely finds itself at the heart of local politics as well. Indeed, one of the main debates that took place in Amherst last Fall revolved around the necessity of expanding and rebuilding the library. It even led to a referendum, which saw the local population hugely support the librarians’ proposal. Finally, the library is a keeper of the town’s memory: as you may have seen if you’ve walked Amity Street, the Jones is the Amherst Historical Society closest neighbor, and it’s no surprise if it keeps both an Emily Dickinson as well as a Robert Frost collection.
Now you may think I’m a little bit too enthusiastic. It’s just a house filled with books, after all. Well, as they say in Toronto, “I’m library people”. Indeed, I must confess, I’m a little biased: I’ve had a library card since I was two years old, my best friend from high-school works as a librarian, and the one and only internship I’ve ever had was at my neighborhood’s branch library. But come on, there’s a reason for such excitement! Don’t you ever feel the awe expressed by poetess Nikki Giovanni, whose verses in “My first memory (of librarians)” recalls:
The welcoming smile of my librarian
The anticipation in my heart
All those books—another world—just waiting
At my fingertips
Indeed, all kinds of documents are at hand! Cook books and travel guides, picture books and graphic novels, CDs and DVDs (although, to be completely fair, Frost Library actually possesses an amazing movie collection)… all for free! Among the thousands of documents that await you at the library, you may find a gem. Some of these books will help you kill time, while some will prove life-changing. There are books that will make your day, and others that will stay with you for years; books that help you understand how your mind and body work; books that make you believe in the power of friendship after someone has let you down; books that teach you valuable skills.
If this is not enough, if the collection lacks anything you need, well, don’t worry: the Central and Western MAssachusetts Resource Sharing protocol (CWMAS) is simply incredible. Encompassing a hundred libraries in our part of the Commonwealth, it allows you to make loans from all those places, all without leaving your own town (although you may see this as an invitation to discover the region). If the book or CD you’re looking for isn’t available in Amherst, maybe you can get it from Northampton or Adams? Just ask the librarian, and next week you’ll get an email: “hold is available for pickup”. A rainy day in South Hadley? Lost in Belchertown? Stuck in Deerfield? No-brainer: just go to the local library. Your card will work there.
Despite the banners hanging from the street lamps, I didn’t fall in love with Amherst. Of course, we have the mountains and the Pond, the river and the farms, the forest and plenty of trails. Of course there were cafes and donuts, welcoming parishes and a movie theater. Nonetheless, it was Jones library that had the biggest impact on my daily life. Out of the blue, or during my Saturday morning routine, I would find myself relaxing on a sofa in the youth section, or browsing The New Yorker in a comfortable armchair. In his 1989 book, The Great Good Place, American sociologist Ray Oldenburg developed the concept of the “third place”: a place that’s neither home nor work, where you can go and relax, enjoy the simple pleasures of life, and connect with your environment. It can be a cafe or a community center, but libraries are serious candidates too. That’s pretty much how I see the Jones.
This article wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t mention the two little sisters of our main library. If this letter results in a massive flow of visitors, and the Jones becomes crowded, they would offer a safe alternative. Even in the current context, they allow you to distinguish yourself from classmates: not only are you not going to Frost, but you’re bypassing Jones as well! If you’re such a hipster, go to North or South, the two complementary locations of our library system. It’s an amazing walk to South Amherst and the elegant Munson Library. If you feel like going to Puffer’s Pond or the Mill District instead, then you can stop by North Amherst Library; just ride the PVTA.
Even now that I’ve left Amherst College, I still receive the Library’s newsletter each week, along with the Student’s emails. I’m always glad to read them both.

2022-12-07,We Have a Problem With Paying Attention,"
“These couple of weeks are a little bit different because of the World Cup. I’ve been watching soccer games in every single one of my classes,” one student told me last week. This student is evidently not alone: In one of my classes last Wednesday, which overlapped with the Mexico versus Saudi Arabia and the Argentina versus Poland games, I observed at least six students dutifully tuned-in to the World Cup broadcast. But while we might be tempted to write off the weeks of the World Cup as an anomaly, this past week has exposed issues with in-class distractions that have plagued Amherst students since long before the tournament began.
Throughout the semester, I have informally studied the various activities my classmates engage in when they are not paying attention. I have observed two students, on multiple occasions, spend entire class periods browsing financial analyst internship opportunities on Handshake. I have caught students watching professional volleyball, feature length films, and Super Smash Bros gameplay. I have noticed students playing Wordle, shopping for new bathing suits, and writing essays for different classes. And, of course, I have seen students spend countless hours over the course of the semester checking their emails or responding to texts.
While the things that students do in class might be surprising, the fact that so many students struggle to pay attention in class is not. A 2010 study by Wharton Senior Fellow Matt Killingsworth and Harvard Professor Daniel Gilbert found that “​​stimulus-independent thought or mind wandering appears to be the brain’s default mode of operation.” In fact, Killingsworth and Gilbert concluded that humans spend about 47% of the time thinking about something unrelated to what they are currently doing. This propensity for mind wandering is independent of the activity in which an individual is engaged — whether that be watching a movie or attending a lecture.
With that said, there are certain factors that make it easier or harder for students to pay attention in class. The most obvious example is the length of the class. In recent years, young people who regularly use social media sites like Instagram and TikTok have grown used to the rapid dopamine hits that these platforms deliver. Combined with the long stretch of online classes during the Coronavirus pandemic, when one student told me he would spend class “playing video games and watching YouTube,” it is near-impossible to pay attention during the entirety of an 80 minute — or even 50 minute — class.
While it is unlikely that the administration would ever shorten classes, there are strategies that professors can employ to make long classes more bearable. Certain professors, for example, give their classes a short break halfway through their lecture. And while the correlation could be entirely spurious, it appears that students in my class with a three minute break spend much less time on their phones than students in my classes without breaks. In support of this conclusion, psychologist Gemma Briggs argues that “we’ve got a wealth of information in our heads about what normally happens in given situations, what we can expect. And those expectations and our experiences directly mold what we see and how we process information in any given time."" So, the expectation of a break after 40 minutes would lead students to more actively pay attention in the time preceding and following the break. For professors interested in improving participation and engagement in their classes, a short mid-lecture break is a simple, low-cost tool.
When I asked Fran Torres ’26 about the cases in which he finds it most difficult to pay attention in class, he told me that “it depends on the style of lecture” and that “when the class size is bigger, there’s not as much one-on-one talking, so your attention can start to slip.” This observation — that students’ attention spans are mediated by the professor’s style of lecture and the size of the class — yields some possible solutions. First, you could find professors whose lecture style requires students to be actively engaged, such as those who cold call students or who integrate activities and small group discussions into their lectures. Second, you could register for smaller classes in which, as Torres told me, “Not paying attention isn’t an option.”
There are some obvious flaws with the aforementioned suggestions, namely that you cannot always control for your professor’s lecture style nor is it feasible to only take small classes throughout your Amherst career. Does this mean that students have to take it upon themselves to try harder to not get distracted during class? Unfortunately, this strategy is unlikely to prove successful. As University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth notes, “Willpower is a limiting resource, it’s unpleasant and we’re not willing to do it for very long, so the best thing to do is create a situation where it’s just harder to be distracted.” Duckworth’s research introduces what she terms “situation modification,” which refers to the process of changing your physical environment to remove temptations. This is in contrast to what she terms “response modulation,” or trying to “voluntarily suppress an undesirable impulse or amplify a desirable one.”
Say, for example, that you frequently find yourself distracted by your phone. In the context of class, Duckworth’s notion of “situation modification” could mean turning off your phone’s notifications or leaving your phone in your backpack, as opposed to relying on your willpower to not pick up your phone every time you receive a notification. This strategy is closely related to what is known as a “commitment strategy,” or a structural constraint that you impose on yourself when you have one set of preferences — “I want to pay attention during class” — that does not align with a set of preferences in the future — “I want to check this text.” Thus, if you know you lack the willpower to not check your phone during class, better to not have your phone accessible in the first place.
As the examples at the beginning of this article suggest, however, eliminating phones as a distraction only solves part of the problem. Most of the time that students spend distracted they do so on their computers, which they have out to take notes, access readings, or use class-specific software. Professors who do not allow technology, then, are implementing a sort of paternalistic situation modification for their students. If students cannot control how they use their technology, then prohibiting it altogether makes it impossible for students to succumb to their lack of willpower.
Some students support these no technology policies: “You should not be copying down what the professor is saying, word for word, anyway,” Jaden Richards ’25 told me, in response to the argument that having access to Google Docs and Word makes it easier to take notes. He added that not being able to mindlessly write down every word that your professor is saying compels students to think critically and creates a more stimulating learning environment. “The students who don’t pay attention in class are dead weight,” Richards added.
Naturally, many students find having access to technology beneficial. “I hate printing out my readings and underlining them. It just works way better for me to annotate on the computer, and I feel like I can compile my thoughts more clearly,” Inés Rossi ’25 told me. But apart from the practical arguments that computers and tablets save paper, increase efficiency, and aid organization, some students also object to the paternalistic nature of the no technology policies — or at least argue that Amherst students deserve a certain amount of autonomy, and that these students should suffer the consequences if they abuse it. “We’re at the stage of our lives where we have to be responsible for our own education,” Harrison Lundy ’25 argued. While structural solutions like banning technology are the proven best-practice for eliminating distractions and improving attention spans, they are no panacea.
Ultimately, some of the root causes of students’ short attention spans might be out of our control: “I feel like all of my friends are very tired this year. Everyone’s in a constant state of stress. Everyone seems a little bit less engaged,” Rossi noted. Most of the students I talked to estimated that they spend 70% of class paying attention and 30% of class zoned-out or distracted. If true, it’s a figure that bests Killingsworth’s and Gilbert’s finding that humans’ minds wander 47% of the time. Nonetheless, 30% is 15 minutes lost during a 50 minute class, and while I would not go so far as to say that students who do not pay attention are “dead weight,” it is detrimental to both our individual and our collective learning experience when some students are scrolling through Twitter or deleting emails during class time. And while there is no simple solution for lengthening students’ attention spans, one thing is clear: if we hope to improve engagement during class, expecting students to simply control their attention will not get us far.

2022-12-07,Mammoth Mind-Pho-ness: Giving Thanks Away From Amherst,"
Thanksgiving is a cheerful holiday that you can spend with family, friends, or — if you’ve been planning well for a long time — both. I need to travel 8,500 miles from Amherst to get to my home in Ho Chi Minh City and 3,000 miles to visit my aunt’s house in Anaheim. Fares are proportional to geographical distance, and we don’t need a calculation to conclude that a two-way ticket to either of those cities would cost an arm and a leg. With this knowledge and less than a month left in the U.S., I made up my mind to spend the one-week break venturing into two of America’s biggest cities: Chicago and Saint Paul.
When I arrived at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, it felt like Christmas had been in the air for eons. Aside from frosty snow and foggy breath, I saw people hugging at the airport as if they hadn’t seen each other in ages in temperatures well-below freezing. That warm impression as a tourist highlighted a fact: I was the only tourist I knew of there. Taking 54 Eastbound to The Saint Paul Hotel, I got off at the station, and my jaw dropped at the absolutely luminous scenery in front of my eyes. From the Landmark Center and Landmark Plaza to Rice Park, everywhere was ornamented with light. If Justin Bieber’s “Mistletoe” had been on the radio, I might have been tricked into thinking I was one of the 2011 festive music video extras. As Christmas was approaching, I was ready for this adventure.
If truth be told, no matter how well prepared you are, you will never be able to comprehend the strange rhythm of life’s troubles. They are as unwavering as Covid, and even if you get the recommended shots and boosters, you can still go down with them. Trying to find accommodations in both cities, I experienced a few of these troubles. In St. Paul, the hotel agent told me that if I didn’t have a debit or credit card, I wouldn’t be able to spend the night at the hotel even though I had already pre-paid for the room. In Chicago, I discovered that the room I had booked was a shared room instead of the separate room that I had originally planned.
Of course, I had to use my gray matter to the fullest during my time away from Amherst. Faced with the excuse that “this is a 100-year-old hotel and we cannot process digital forms of transaction,” I responded that a good hotel in our time is a commodity that provides both paid lodging and a positive experience to the guests, and that I couldn’t understand how a hotel that only accepted conventional payment methods could survive in the 21st century.
I told him that I was an international student visiting Minnesota for the first time. My bank cards were running into problems, and my mother was in Vietnam. Back then, I didn’t know if my argument really held any grounds (LJST majors — if you happen to be reading this part — please turn a blind eye). However, at that moment, I truly had a strong belief in what I was saying. I believed that I did nothing wrong to convince them to use another form of deposit so I could lay my back down in a cozy room, after an early morning trip from Amherst to South Station to the airport, two hours of airport delays, an interstate flight, and a Metroline bus downtown. As a result, the hotel agent spoke to the manager, and I was upgraded to the Queen's room as compensation for the mental damage I had suffered.
That night, I was hungry, and although all the stores were almost closed, my Google Maps detected an Asian noodle shop near my hotel closing at 11 p.m. When I left at 10:15 p.m., walking away from the block of my hotel, lights were still on, but danger started to become more salient. While snapping pictures of the scenes around me, I noticed some men smoking and heading towards me. I took a breath and hurried to the noodle shop at breakneck speed, pretending to be on the phone with my aunt. Yes, I still wanted the noodles. Next mission: getting back to the hotel. Worrying that criminals would be most likely to attack someone who appears kind, I called my dad on speakerphone as I walked.
I was terrified that night, especially after a staff member advised me “be careful, but nothing serious should happen to you” when I asked about going to the nearest station to top up my Metroline card. I decided to put the brakes on my solo exploration and look for an alternative way to spend my time after 6 p.m.: hitting the hotel’s 12th floor fitness center.
Three days later, I was preparing for my trip to Chicago. I stayed at the FreeHand Chicago, and I totally recommend it. From my hotel, it was only a one-minute walk to the Pizzeria Uno — birthplace of deep dish pizza, where I quickly learned that, if you go alone, you can get in faster than a group. In Chicago, I decided to walk between locations as much as possible, both to save money and to familiarize myself with the place. Roaming Chicago streets is like a chess game, and each skyscraper has its own architectural characteristics that make figuring out your location in the city by looking at the skyline a memory game in and of itself.
Although there were moments of fright and terrors that surfaced as I wandered through Chicago, and unexpected obstacles during my time in St. Paul, I returned from the trip having taken a few more steps forward on the path to becoming a real adult. Progress was made as I went down the list of possible necessities like toothbrush and toothpaste, and when I made the hard choice to pick out only a few costumes to fit in my carry-on luggage. This would make it hard for me to forget anything important while I was traveling. Progress happened when I realized that there was no Valentine Dining Hall where I could get food without limit, and that a breakfast including eggs benedict, creme brulee, soy milk, and service fees cost me 50 dollars. Progress happened when I bought three bowls of Nongshim noodles and two bottles of Smartwater for a total of 10 dollars, dodging the problem that even just two Smartwater water bottles at the hotel cost 12 dollars. Progress happened when the hotel did not have an electric kettle, and I learned to cook noodles with a Kellogg coffeemaker.
Progress happened when I decided to pay an extra $300 to upgrade to a single hotel room in Chicago, concerned that sharing rooms with a stranger in a bustling city might put not only my valuables but my life at potential peril.
Progress happened when I learned that you can create your own must-go destinations list without mindlessly checking off an online list of recommendations. Landmarks are only for tourists, but talking to locals will help you find the real hidden gems. Instead of going to the Contemporary Art Museum, I chose the Museum of Ice Cream. By the end of that visit, I could pride myself on being a short-term ice cream roll maker for a street vendor with Ice Cream Lab, and learning to say “No” to getting more ice cream (even though an entrance ticket guarantees unlimited access to all desserts).
Progress happened when I brought a charger to recharge my gadgets on the go, and progress happened when I combined Google Maps and marked-by-memory landmarks to navigate roads to get back to the hotel safely.
All in all, I was able to reassure my family when I was traveling alone. I really took heed of everyone’s advice and prioritized my safety when traveling to cities where guns were free to use. Actually, before arranging my week-long trip, I asked a Chinese friend of mine to travel with me. Her face turned panicky: “Why would you go to Chicago? It’s not safe there for us Asians, and you’re a girl too.” She told me to be careful and wished me good luck, and I think her blessing worked.
I have learned how to enjoy time being alone, and those short six days made me believe that I could live alone happily after graduating.

Spending time in two places colder than Amherst is definitely one of my more unorthodox decisions, but those two places nonetheless brought me joy in the most special way. I had already had the experience of living away from home in South Korea, but I felt safe there because I was in a country sharing much of the culture I was born and raised in. I’m glad I bit the bullet this Thanksgiving and went to places I was far more unfamiliar with. A total of six days spent in Chicago and Saint Paul is probably not enough for me to fully understand those cities, but I can definitely be relied on for useful advice if you’re ever planning to visit these two cities for a short time.

2022-12-07,Mammoth Mind-Pho-ness: Languages as a Catalyst for Growth,"
This opinion piece has been a long time coming, for I have dodged it for as long as I can. People who know me can tell I can speak more than two languages — English and Vietnamese, one for classes and the other for family, along with Mandarin Chinese and Korean. Currently, I am also taking online Arabic and Thai lessons with my Vietnam-based teachers. Musing on my 21-year journey, I have unearthed a forest of thoughts buried like ancient relics.
When I reached kindergarten age, my mom put me in an English learning center. I always felt a ton of pressure just understanding what was going on in class. My attention was thereby limited in scope: My whole world revolved around the house, the neighborhood that we lived in, and the classroom. Thoughts like “Everyone already speaks Vietnamese. English for what?” occurred in my mind from time to time. You can tell that there were days when my rebellious thoughts resurfaced and were more active.
During my five years of elementary school, my number one burden was that every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I had to go to the English center to suffer for another 2 hours. I almost always stood near the bottom of the class’s ranking. At the time, English was not yet a subject in elementary schools in Vietnam — phew — so it didn’t really stress me out at the time.
But what I didn’t realize at that time was that those years were just preparing me for the next four years of middle school, where English became the main subject and things became more serious. Suddenly, all the painful years of making myself present at the English center began to pay off. Although I studied poorly at the English center, I was one of the few who had studied English in elementary school. During those four years, I spent time going around helping the whole class with our English homework. Maybe destiny was behind this setup, but this was the way through which I built and grew lifelong friendships with others. Most importantly, I fell in love with teaching — the process of helping someone learn something new, and helping them find passion for that thing. Teaching English made me believe that I could become someone who can contribute to society. Without having to wait until college, I picked up the importance of being good at something, of contributing something to my community, to really breathe easily in that space. Although this belief that you need something to be confident about and not vice versa was wrong, it kept me going.
The summer before tenth grade, I passed the entrance exam for the specialized English class of a gifted high school in the city. At this time, the school announced that all English majors would have to choose between German and French as a third language elective, and I went with the former. One year of indulging in this European language had a tremendous value on my language learning progress: it set a solid foundation for me to gauge the development of English through observation of the words that it borrowed from the German language.
I decided to study abroad in the 11th grade. My aunt was able to find a Christian school near her house. But also while living with her, the tectonic plates in me shifted again. My aunt had two boys, and the younger one was diagnosed with autism. Communicating with my cousin was just like learning a new language, with its own linguistic differences to learn from.

Going to an American high school, I absorbed a basket of new languages. Since most of the students came from abroad, they felt comfortable conversing in their mother tongue whenever possible. The hallways were filled with the static of multiple languages spoken at the same time, and walking through it for two years in a row made me believe that I was speaking less English than I did in Vietnam. Curious about the meaning of all these different languages, I decided to make sense of them by teaching myself Chinese and Korean during the remaining 2 years of high school.

A wise decision may seem trivial when it is first made. It was the college application period, and I never gave up on carrying on with the newest episodes of various K-dramas and C-dramas on Netflix. This caused me to receive many criticisms from family and friends, who asked me why I only watched movies all day. But those decisions only bloom when you stick with them, regardless of outside influences. Before Covid happened, I was able to take language proficiency exams in Chinese (the HSK4) and Korean (TOPIK) in California.

Back to reality at Amherst, there are times when I am so stressed from classwork that I just want to disappear from anything related to the college for a short time. I often ran off to downtown Amherst for a slight breath of fresh air. Using my linguistic command, I became acquainted with a Hokkien waitress at Fresh Cafe, was treated more enthusiastically by the Chinese waitress after promptly switching to Chinese when I realized she didn’t speak English, accidentally learned that the owners of Ricelicious and Taste Thai are relatives, and that Vietnamese restaurant Omi Omy’s owner is a Taiwanese woman who used to run a Taiwanese noodle restaurant before Covid.
The experience of attending a high school with immigrant and multilingual teachers, and studying with multilingual classmates, has made me understand the difficulties of adapting to a culture I was not originally raised in. I am just grateful that such understanding powerfully transformed into a sense of sympathy, allowing me to go into others’ lives and listen to their stories with all my heart.
Back to reality, my time in Amherst was counting down, and by the time I knew I wanted to set up a Vietnamese Table as a RSO, I had already packed up to go back to my home institution in South Korea. Although I will be so many miles away, I will still follow every step of the college, hoping that one day a student who can speak and write my mother tongue will take an initiative, continuing the dream.
I wasn’t lucky enough to have access to multiple languages as a child, but I’ve found that mastering more than one language is similar to passing an interview for a consulting firm. If you consider knowing the language as prestigious as a job to chase after graduation, you will be willing to go to the same great lengths as when you prep for a case.
Although my younger self wished that I could wander around the globe and acquire natural fluency, I feel lucky to have been born in Vietnam. As a developing country, Vietnam receives aid from other countries. In return, these aid-givers want people to learn their languages. To me, Vietnam is like a child endowed with too many expectations from its parents. In the past, French classes were offered in many schools in the South, and Russian and Chinese were an option in the North. Later, the Minister of Education also added German, Japanese, and Korean as electives. Because of that, Vietnamese people seem comfortable around new languages. In Vietnam, even one without proper education will try to speak English with you.
My life has grappled with many ups and lots of downs, and these experiences have been tied closely to languages. As one can sense, some hills were so high that the only way out was to go down. God bless, I was able to pick myself up off the ground every time I fell. Perhaps it’s a blessing in disguise, perhaps risks are meant to be taken, and the difficulties at that time were what was needed for a fruitful happy ending. At Amherst, I really struggled to learn a new layer of English. Everyone here also speaks English, but a more advanced kind of English, and I have never been in an environment where everyone speaks at this same level. Honestly, I was very sad during my time here because I couldn’t fully understand everyone’s conversation, but I have faith that my time here has laid the groundwork for brighter days.
This is a long-winded letter (which is understandable considering I’ve waited years to write about this), and I think it reflects how long the road has been. I am grateful that on this journey of many destinies, I have used the privilege of my free will to achieve the results I desire. This is important and good news that I want to share with everyone.

2022-11-30,People Like You More Than You Think,"
For the first few months that I knew my best friend at Amherst, I thought he hated me. I am not exaggerating. Whenever I caught him typing on his computer in our dorm’s second-floor common room and loudly greeted his presence, he would return, at best, a hesitant smile and wave, or, more frequently, a glowering stare and an inaudible response. I am not sure what kept me from giving him up; maybe I saw acquiring his friendship as a feat to conquer, the social equivalent of that one impossible boss in “Undertale.” But while I have yet to beat Sans, I did win my now-best-friend over with my stubbornly vivacious greetings, a couple of big-group nature walks blasting 2010s pop hits on a speaker, and funny socks for a birthday gift. It turned out that he was just quiet — he didn’t hate my guts (or, at the very least, he eventually learned how to tolerate me).
I saw him as a special case. More often than not, when I meet new people on campus, I assume they do not like me — that they actively do not enjoy my company — and I tend to keep my distance. I see their stares ahead while I pass them on the quad, our short and superficial small-talk exchanges in line at Val, and our awkward glances in group conversations as indicators that they most certainly do not want to get to know me more, that they are tolerating my presence but would rather be somewhere else. As it turns out, I am not alone in this feeling.
A new study revealed a simple yet revolutionary finding: We significantly underestimate the amount that other people like us. Psychologists term this the “liking gap,” which describes the consistent difference between how much we perceive others as liking us within social interactions and how much they actually like us. If you feel like half of the Amherst campus actively dislikes you, you are not alone. You are probably just very wrong.
This is a pretty important finding, considering that a fairly recent survey found that more than three out of four Amherst students report experiencing extreme loneliness while on campus. This is significantly higher than the national college student average, which is a little more than half.
How can we use this discovery to combat campus loneliness and foster a campus environment that encourages the building of fulfilling relationships? As a fellow student, I offer a couple of my own thoughts and encourage you to form your own additional conclusions while reflecting on this information.
First, let’s stop buying into the culture of social coldness. If we continue to interact under the illusion of the liking gap, we, as a campus community, will perpetuate the false norm that most Amherst students are not interested in socializing. As this belief is evidently wrong, continuing to perpetuate it will only hinder our willingness and ability to interact socially. I think it is safe to say that most of us would love to make a good new friend.
Also, try waving enthusiastically. What I mean by this is: Put good effort into communicating fondness or desire to get to know someone better, whether that means sprinkling them with compliments, giving them an exaggeratedly friendly wave or warm hug (with their consent, of course), asking them to grab a meal one-on-one sometime, or anything else that exhibits your genuine liking and interest.
While bridging the liking gap will require changing our mindsets to recognize that people like us more than we think they do, we can also diminish these misunderstandings from others by changing the way we interact with others. Let’s overcome our initial social worries and put more effort into our gestures toward those that we wish to get to know better, even if they at first seem uninterested. Doing so might help us overcome any liking-gap-related misconceptions they might hold and make them feel more comfortable reciprocating the feelings and willingness to build a friendship. Wouldn’t you be interested in befriending someone whose entire day seems to brighten when they see you?
I’m not trying to argue that these ideas or shifts in behavior will abolish campus loneliness or feelings of isolation, but they may empower us to create a warmer campus environment in which we feel more easily able to connect with others and build meaningful relationships. Knowing this information about the liking gap helped me feel more comfortable — both in the relationships I already have on campus, and with the ones I want to build. I hope the same is true for you. We may not necessarily meet our new college best friend every time we overcome the liking gap, but we may spark a wonderful connection that we might have otherwise passed by. Let’s bridge the liking gap, one enthusiastic greeting at a time.
A final disclaimer: If you see me manically smiling or waving at you as I walk by, you now know why.

2022-11-30,Kayah’s Korner: A Low-income Student’s Guide to Navigating “Success”,"
Anonymous asks, “Hi Mikayah! How do you practice self-love especially when it comes to feeling like you have the weight of being successful at Amherst College for your family and loved ones? At times, it feels like I exert so much pressure on myself especially when I think about all the family members that are looking up to me. As a FLI student, have you felt this way as well?”
Dear Anonymous,
I too have felt the many pressures of achieving “success” as a FLI student at Amherst. I’d like to offer you an ideological response to your question.
I recommend shifting your mindset. When I arrived at Amherst, I adopted certain beliefs that influenced the way I presented myself on campus. The conversations taking place around me reflected a jargon I didn’t possess and markers of wealth such as expensive coats or summer experiences. The environment felt like a pressure cooker of status that I felt alien to. I was determined to prove that I belonged here — I felt that I needed to justify my presence in the student body by doing something phenomenal. What I failed to realize was that I am already phenomenal. I don’t need to know you, Anonymous, to know that you are too. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t.
The thing that we often have to communicate to ourselves is how many definitions of success exist. To get to Amherst, many of us bought into a system of beliefs that glorifies higher education and depreciates the very backgrounds we hail from. Therefore, our very conception of what it means for a FLI student to attend college entails positioning ourselves at an intersection of oppositional identities. We begin to view success as a funnel that eventually pours out into things such as influence and capital, stressing about grades and how they’ll affect career outcomes or graduate school applications.
At the same time, we remember examples of success in our lives prior to our arrival at Amherst. For many of us, that looked like insane levels of productivity — seeing our family members work multiple jobs or juggling several responsibilities ourselves. When these ideas of success converge, we’re left with an impossible definition of success that suggests our time at Amherst can only be justified by how much quantifiable product we produce — how much capital we make or how productive we are. When you look at it like this, I hope it becomes clear to you why you might feel overwhelmed by a sense of duty to these definitions of success.
And so I ask you, Anonymous, to evolve your definition of success — to allow yourself room for grace in your conception of the world around you and how you see yourself fitting into it. Remind yourself that success does not have to be so quantifiable or limited. Remind yourself, too, of how complicated these definitions of success already are. When you close your eyes and imagine where you come from, whatever that may mean to you, remember the love you feel in your imagination. Find the experiences that make you feel an unmatched sense of love. With that image in mind, I encourage you to revise your definition of success.
Success, for me, is the impact I make in the world around me. I didn’t say how much impact. I merely said, “impact.” Having a conversation with a customer while I work the register at Frost Cafe is impactful. Calling my mother and offering her advice or receiving advice from her are also both impactful in different ways. Writing this column and sharing my experience with other students so they feel less alone is another form of impact. Whatever I do in my life, in order to feel fulfilled, I need to see myself connected to what I’m doing by creating this impact.
When you feel tempted to admonish yourself for a lack of academic output or for underperformance, I encourage you to practice grace. Ask yourself what you’ve done to make an impact in your personal life or someone else’s. Encourage yourself to find the things that give you a sense of fulfillment independent from the expectations of others. If you tap into the image of love or fulfillment discussed earlier, what do you see yourself doing inside it? Once you’ve answered that, begin to move the pieces of your life around those things — because those things are your needs, the things you need to thrive.
At the end of the day, grappling with your question will not end overnight. It’s an iterative process that requires a conscious effort to shift and adapt both your self-perception and your outlook on the world around you. It requires changing your mindset and exposing yourself to a variety of experiences that unlock that certain feeling.
I know that much of what I’ve written here feels intangible, but I encourage you to go after deconstructing your understanding of success by starting small and in several ways. Find things that make an immediate impact, even if the impact is an opportunity for self-care. Journaling helps me reflect on the places in my life I feel most fulfilled. Calling a friend or family member makes me feel an incredible sense of love. Taking a walk around campus helps me clear my mind and practice relaxation. The type of extracurricular activities I engage in speak to my values. Even the cheesy romantic comedies I watch to unwind reflect the elements I need to see in a given moment. I can’t prescribe you a specific combination of things because it looks different for everyone, but these are the larger ideas and the smaller first steps I ask you to keep in mind — to understand, to apply, to complicate — as you imagine yourself at Amherst College.
Lastly, Anonymous, I’m proud of you. Thank you so much for reaching out.
Until next time,
Kayah

2022-11-30,What Does Amherst Owe Democracy?,"
Harvard, Holy Cross, Princeton, Princeton, Princeton, Columbia, Yale, Rhodes, Harvard. You may think I’m just naming a bunch of schools worse than Amherst (and I am), but I'm actually listing off the institutions where every current U.S. Supreme Court Justice received their undergraduate degree — almost all of which are elite colleges. In the midst of corroding trust in our nation’s institutions and the pillaging of them by a narrow circle of elites like those on the Supreme Court, it’s important to recognize the role that we — those who comprise the bodies of the elite institutions that train our nation’s democratic elites — have played and continue to play in the death of American democracy. The crisis of leadership starts here, at Amherst and its peer institutions, and any failure to produce civic-minded, responsive leaders should be seen as the fault of these institutions.
Elite institutions like Amherst need to take ownership of Clarence Thomas, for example, the same way they enthusiastically take credit for Barack Obama — because, whether they like it or not, it is they who produced him. Thomas, the Supreme Court justice who worked to overturn Roe v. Wade, and is currently working to dismantle affirmative action, graduated near the top of his class at Yale Law. He exemplified what it means to a successful student at such an institution. The problem, however, is that the notion of success upheld by these institutions often doesn’t have any real place for public service. Elite schools like Amherst that only pay lip service to public service, still simultaneously uphold a number of hidden systems and incentives (like those that sent a third of our 2021 graduates to Wall Street) that have given and will continue to give us a corrupt and disreputable elite. Amherst owes it not only to us, but to society at-large, to uncover these hidden incentives and seek to change them — because Amherst, and its peer institutions, owe our democracy its future leaders.
One might say the entire system of elite education is more focused on reproducing the class system than it is on producing future leaders. Students here at Amherst are overwhelmingly wealthy, and disproportionately choose to go into wealth-making professions like finance and consulting. We are, in some sense, no better than the aristocrats of old. We frequently take advantage of our privilege at the expense of society at large, and there is no doubt that the entire system of elite education is at fault. The very things that get us into schools like Amherst — the crafting of pristine resumés, working endlessly to achieve a high gpa, even at the expense of learning — no doubt, are at fault. We begin the rat race in our high school years, and colleges like Amherst often never compel us to step outside of it and think about what our responsibilities to the world may be.
There is the question of whether or not Amherst encourages its students to learn to be responsive to the needs of our democracy. I believe it is not currently doing enough. The very idea of the college campus was born out of a need for elite institutions to find a way to protect America’s best and brightest from the corrupting influences of nearby cities — and Amherst was no different, with some buildings here being built to intentionally face away from the town. While the idea of constructing secluded campuses to protect students from public vice has since fallen out of favor, one can still see its effects exemplified in issues like the town-gown divide, or the divide that exists between college students and the residents of the town in which the college is located. Amherst College is as a castle on a hill — and students can easily fall victim to a cloistered elitism, which encourages them to grow unresponsive to the needs of their community simply because they don’t have to be.
While many students here at Amherst do manage to successfully bridge the town-gown divide, the problem here is these students had to independently go out of their way to do so. Initiatives that encourage students to learn outside of the Amherst bubble, should be opt-out, and not opt-in. Here, I would advocate the proliferation, and perhaps requirement, of community-based learning courses. These courses “link learning both inside and outside the classroom,” mandating that students not only learn from their textbooks, lectures, and in-class discussions, but from the world around them. A new club, Amherst Students for Democracy (ASFD), has recognized not only this need, but is pushing it to the forefront with their upcoming pledge for students to do social impact work during their time at Amherst.
We, as Amherst students and democratic citizens, find the need for strong, responsive leadership renewed and ever-so-urgent in our time of imperial decay. However, as it currently stands, there is much more Amherst could be doing to counteract current trends in the production of our democratic elite. Among them would be working to shift the culture within the college, and bridging the town-gown divide.
William Deresiewicz once powerfully noted that “the disadvantage of an elite education is that it’s given us the elite we have, and the elite we’re going to have.” What we’re facing in America is a crisis of leadership — and it is the responsibility of Amherst and its peers to once again take up the task of educating responsive, civic-minded leaders. The fate of our nation hangs in the balance.

2022-11-30,Mammoth Mind-Pho-ness: Adulting at and After Amherst,"
Who among us hasn’t fantasized at one point or another about having more time to discover our limitless potential within the comfort of the Amherst bubble before going into the outside world? But, alas, our time here is finite. In the blink of an eye, you reach graduation, and you are left to stand on your own feet. From improving credit scores and paying utility bills to doing your taxes and choosing your insurance package, you are faced with many new responsibilities all at once. This can make adulting seem like a post-grad nightmare, but fear not — you aren’t alone in this journey! To give you a head start, here are some fresh pieces of advice that can hopefully help guide you on the right path to life as a newbie grown-up.
Remember Your Items
In terms of size, Amherst is elegantly humble. But when looking for a lost item, zoo-wee-mama does the campus appear big. And, of course, it is inevitable that each of us will lose things at times. If you are a member of AmherstBussin with notifications on, you can probably recall plenty of times when your phone buzzed with multiple messages from different people for the same purpose — finding their lost items. While at Amherst, we have resources like this to help us relocate our belongings, but after four years, we will have to face the wider world. There will be no group chat or community to turn to for help with your lost valuables. Fortunately, you can take some easy first steps to help solve this problem: Make digitized scans of your IDs, and keep your important belongings inside at fixed locations so you can always go back to the exact place just for them.
Figure Out Your Finances
Money may not be a big deal for a wealthy, heavily endowed institution like Amherst, but it is a serious unresolved problem for us students. It’s why we spend our years in college taking classes and doing internships that will help us land jobs that will make us money and motivate us to continue each morning. Splurging comes with a feeling of power, and that is why we are always tempted to spend.
In an era where machines are slowly replacing manual work, we see thousands of white-collar employees being laid off at Meta and other top corporations on the grounds that the economy is shrinking and organizational restructuring has become a necessity. It is even more important to have a personal fund to fall back on during these trying times. Being at a liberal arts college in a faraway town saves us from spending on stores that otherwise will be found in the city. However, spontaneous trips to New York City or Washington, D.C. for the weekend and unplanned online shopping sprees during Black Friday or Cyber ​​Monday sales can leave you cleaned out in no time. Right now, most of us indulge in the luxury of living on campus “rent-free” after having our parents pay a lump sum at the start of each semester. It is essential to maintain control of our budget while it’s still easy. Maintaining awareness of your balance and making necessary changes to your spending as needed are essential to obtaining financial stability. No high-paying corporate job can guarantee you this stability if you don’t spend wisely. Use your banking app’s budgeting tool to track your financial progress and plan a well-thought out budget so that you don’t have to go through days stressing about making ends meet.
Make Time for the People You Care About
Spending quality time with your friends is how you show them that they have an important place in your heart. If you constantly let your schoolwork be the excuse for missing Val meals with your friends, then you’ll struggle even more when you try to plan an intercity reunion with them years after graduation. While you’re still an Amherst student, you benefit from the immediate proximity to your friends on campus. Consider these whimsical strolls and dining hall get-togethers as a time to get close with your loved ones. When we graduate from Amherst, what’s left in our heads won’t be the ridiculously tough problem sets assigned in “Logic,” but the time we spent with our friends at the dining hall ranting about the difficulty of that class. Refrain from filling those gaps in an already packed day on your Google Calendar — they are meant for the important people in your life.
Give Yourself Enough Rest
“Work or rest?” is a quandary that each of us faces, especially on days when the balance is just impossible to strike and you have to choose. Amherst’s notorious workload seemingly never ends, but you shouldn’t give up your sleep time. When you work too hard and too long, the only thing that remains in your head is a ramshackle machinery constantly pressuring you to stop or rush to get that work done over. If we understand them well, school assignments are not merely there for us to complete. They are assigned with the true purpose of sharpening our application of the knowledge learned in class. Meet with your professors to develop an appropriate plan to help you get the rest that your body needs. There is definitely an exercise hidden behind every assignment you are given. Future-you will be grateful to present-you for not missing out on solving them.
Stand Your Ground
Adulthood marks a new level of maturity in your thoughts and actions. Upon entering the adult world, you must bear in mind that you will be solely responsible for the decisions you make and their consequences. Take caution when doing something, even if it may be done out of good intention to support someone. “Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye,” as the author H. Jackson Brown, Jr. once said. Use all of your five senses to judge matters. Don’t fall victim to peer pressure simply because the majority is doing it. Pluck up your courage and speak your mind. In many cases, it’s best to remain silent as a form of protest in a world where people resort to violence, money, or a zillion other means to threaten your belief systems. Yes, it feels like you’re running solo against an entire world, and it’s undeniable feelings of uncertainties and tiredness may run amok every so often. In this context, the Korean proverb “존버는 승리한다” that basically means “enduring wins all” is what you need to carve into your heart. We are Amherst students and we are here because we want to be here. Similar to this spirit, it is a core tenet of life to act in concordance with our beliefs. Standing up for what we believe shapes us into a complete individual, thereby making us rightful leaders who act for the betterment of our people and communities.
Be Kind at Heart
This advice may seem out of place and moralizing, but it is what will best protect our journey to adulthood. Do something that you think will benefit the world — something that would put your mind at ease if you could do nothing else before you had to leave this Earth. Your actions will accumulate into a bank of “good deeds,” and later on, during difficult times, it is these good deeds that will help you overcome hardship — not the breadth of your educational background, your wealth, or your career successes. This is life’s covenant to protect us before we step out into the scary world beyond Amherst, where kindness eventually wins.
Adulting is a lifelong process. When we finally get the hang of something, another problem will come out of nowhere. It is common knowledge that when life gives us lemons, we are supposed to make lemonade. As Amherst students, I’m sure many of us will make invisible ink out of them to encode secret messages that one can only read under candlelight. One of the things that makes Amherst great is that it is a community filled with individuals who have a strong capacity to develop themselves to achieve success in the future, despite the steep learning curve in adulting. Surrounded by such people, you would be wise to make an effort to learn from your fellow Mammoths and you will be just fine.

2022-11-16,A Columbus Conundrum: Experiencing el Día de la Hispanidad,"
I had never been so acutely aware of my “American-ness” until I went abroad. More specifically, I never realized how many of my most intrinsic beliefs are culturally determined until I was introduced to one of Spain’s most important holidays.
A few weeks ago, the country celebrated its national day or, as they call it here, el Día de la Hispanidad. Because it’s a national holiday, everyone gets the day off from school or work, and an enormous parade takes place throughout the streets of Madrid. I was thrilled to have a day to myself (in Spain, universities don’t have fall breaks, so I take what I can get), and the weather was so beautiful. I loved how much pride everyone had in their Spanish heritage and couldn’t wait to spend the morning walking around Madrid, sightseeing, and immersing myself in the festivities. It wasn’t until I was halfway through my Madrid city biking tour that I realized the true nature of this annual celebration. El Día de la Hispanidad, or “Spanishness” Day, is actually just a glorified version of Columbus Day. In fact, it’s more than that. It’s Columbus Day times 10.
Growing up in Oakland, California, I never celebrated Columbus Day. At my local elementary school, we always called the second Monday of every October Indigenous People’s Day, a date meant to honor the Indigenous communities of the Americas and all that they had endured during the Spanish usurpation of their lands. We were taught that we lived, worked, and breathed on Ohlone soil. (And, as I later learned, Muwekma and the Confederated Villages of Lisjan Territory as well.) We discussed their civilizations and took field trips to their tribal lands, speaking with members of the communities. We investigated the California missions and how they forcefully converted the native populations to Christianity. Most importantly, we learned about the horrors of Columbus’ actions and how his conquest led to the eradication of entire populations.
Long story short, I’ve never supported the existence of Columbus Day, and I always assumed that my own rejection of the holiday was, at some level, universal (naive, I know). Given my background, I think I was especially surprised to learn how large a role Columbus and el Día de la Hispanidad play in Spanish culture.
According to Spanish written law, the annual holiday of “October 12 … symbolizes the historical anniversary on which Spain … [began] a period of linguistic and cultural projection beyond the boundaries of Europe.” In other words, it marks the day on which Columbus reached the Americas and began his mass genocide of Indigenous populations and cultures around the world.
I couldn’t believe that this law nor this day actually existed. Here I was, a born-and-raised Californian, thinking that the U.S. was stuck in the past because some of us still referred to the second Monday in October as Columbus Day. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, there was an entire holiday dedicated to the memory of Columbus’ colonization (or so it seemed to me). It was also surprising to see how seriously the Spaniards took the holiday. There were bells ringing in the streets. A fleet of jet planes flew by, leaving clouds of celebratory smoke in their wake. I saw people wearing the Spanish flag (some had even painted it onto their faces). Nobody seemed even remotely disturbed by the underlying connotations of this holiday.
However, as I’ve gotten to know more Spaniards (specifically Madrileños) over the past couple of weeks, I’ve begun to learn that the national opinion regarding this holiday is more nuanced than I initially thought. While there are definitely many people who proudly celebrate and praise el Día de la Hispanidad, there are others (mainly in the younger generations) who find it distasteful and insensitive. One of my friends told me that she doesn’t agree with the idea behind the holiday because she doesn’t see anything worth celebrating. According to her, although a lot of Spaniards still perceive the “descubrimiento [discovery]” of the Americas to be one of Spain’s proudest moments, there is an increasing number of people who find the “encubrimiento [concealment]” of the Americas (a name they coined) to be despicable.
Another group of Spanish students shared that they — along with many others — are staunchly against wearing the Spanish flag, partially out of principle and partially out of fear of being labeled a fascist, as the flag has evolved into a symbol of xenophobia and hatred over the years (similar to what happened to the American flag after Trump’s election).
I even emailed a Spanish professor at one of the local universities for some additional clarity. She explained that, in addition to its ties to Columbus and Spanish heritage, el Día de la Hispanidad has also historically been viewed as a religious holiday in Spain. For years, it has been a time when citizens pay homage to their Lady of the Pillar (aka la Virgen de Pilar, aka the Virgin Mary). Nevertheless, as one of my program directors pointed out, it’s unclear whether these underlying religious connotations existed before or after Columbus arrived in the Americas. It’s distinctly possible that the Spaniards decided to associate la Virgen de Pilar with el Día con la Hispanidad later on because they wanted to merge two important and seemingly “positive” historical Spanish events together.
What I didn’t realize during my first impression of the holiday is that many people don’t actually associate Oct. 12 with Christopher Columbus (or even religion) anymore; el Día de la Hispanidad has transitioned over the years into being primarily a day of patriotism and a celebration of Spanish culture, similar to what the Fourth of July is for many Americans. Since the Spanish Civil War, people have begun to view the holiday as a day on which to honor those who fought against the dictator Francisco Franco. For people with military ties (and for people without), el Día de la Hispanidad is still meaningful because it represents a love of Spanishness, not necessarily a love of Columbus.
This entire investigation has been an incredibly eye-opening experience for me. Before coming to Spain, I had never really considered how people’s ethical beliefs are shaped by their nationalities. Then, once I learned about the existence of el Día de la Hispanidad, I immediately made assumptions based on my own personal beliefs and experiences. Now, a few weeks and several fascinating conversations later, I’m realizing that everything is so much more ambiguous (and that making assumptions is a dangerous game).
Ultimately, what I really want to emphasize with this article is the subjectiveness of Spain’s National Day and of what is deemed to be “right” or “wrong” within a culture. Although we might firmly believe that we should not commemorate Columbus or his day in Oakland, here in Madrid, the holiday is more complicated. Celebrating el Día de la Hispanidad, including its history, is a part of the culture, and many people will not blink twice if you choose to wear the Spanish flag. There are so many societal paradigms ingrained in our minds based on our places of origin that we cannot possibly comprehend the notion that anybody else might live differently. But they do. And we do. Thus, even though I will never celebrate Columbus Day nor look back fondly on Columbus’ legacy, I cannot speak for the rest of the world. At the end of the day, a lot of what we choose to celebrate is purely cultural, as are many of our beliefs, and that is not for me to decide, regardless of my personal preferences.

2022-11-09,Vandalize College Row!,"
The first-year quad is nothing if not austere. The rows of trees that seem to trace an open-air cathedral are matched in the exactitude of their placement only by the stolid right angles of those Federalist bricks that ring the grassy expanse. College Row, on the quad’s west side, looks out over the valley like a monument: It’s permanent, a symbol of an unchanging and aloof college, committed only to learning. If no students ever walked across the lawns, it wouldn’t look all that different. The aesthetic of the college may be pristine, but that comes at the cost of failing to reflect student life.
That severe austerity is the trademark aesthetic of the rest of campus, too: The spaces students traverse are devoid of art except for the straight-laced design of the buildings. These spaces reflect a sincere desire for learning that is present in students and administration alike, but they are irrelevant to a large part of what living on campus means, in the dynamism of the present.
Supporting the proliferation of public art — especially works made by current students — is a simple way to fix this. Currently, visual art made by students is hard to find. It’s corralled into a few spaces: the Indicator gallery on Frost’s second floor is a great example, as well as the posters and advertisements put up by student organizations around campus. Val is looking for student artists to submit art for their own displays, too, and anyone interested should seek out their poster by the entranceway!
Nevertheless, these places are relatively isolated, and advertisements are relatively ephemeral compared to other types of student art. Apart from this, the highest concentration of student art on campus is in the art department’s own Fayerweather Hall, which has a rotating display of art produced in its classes. Student-produced visual art is thereby relegated to spaces that one has to seek out, making it more or less invisible around campus in general.
Making our shared spaces more available for experimental installations is an essential part of this work. The college should establish application procedures for interested students to install their sculptures on any of the many open spaces we have on campus, hang visual works from the walls in any number of academic or residential buildings, and perhaps even commission a rotating installation in some privileged spot on main campus. Departments like Architectural Studies and Art and the History of Art should be able to exhibit their student’s work in more social spaces on campus like Val and Keefe, and artists who want to create work should have access to the equipment managed by those departments.
There are other authorities on campus who can help to enhance student art: the AAS Arts Committee (which has just sent out a call for student applications!) is charged with advancing the creation and appreciation of art on campus; it currently organizes two concerts per semester and also maintains a “gallery” of student art in Schwemms. This work, while valuable, should be extended to include as much of campus as possible. Student artists should communicate with the Arts committee in order to gain funding and access to equipment for independent projects, and the committee should do all within its power to expand the presence of visual art beyond designated spaces to make it closer to ubiquitous on campus.
The restriction of art to a few privileged spots on campus cordons off student life from the timeless aesthetic of the buildings we walk past. A campus that truly reflects the students that call it home however, should be inseparable from the lives of those students. Campus grounds should be a canvas for student art: If it were, the vistas of the college’s grounds would become an austere backdrop for the lives and experiences of all those who live and work and play here.
Right now, some of the most beautiful spaces on campus are those practically painted with posters and advertisements. It is there that the diversity and vibrancy of student life is most genuinely and colorfully reflected. But student art should never be relegated to fleeting advertisements that may only last for a few days or weeks. Our lives should be obvious to anyone who walks by. Amherst shouldn’t look static. It is inhabited by living people, and its physical space should reflect that, its walls covered and re-covered in murals like an elementary school that centers its students’ experiences of learning, beyond the material itself. This is a campus populated by people, with plenty of painting supplies and a surplus of potential sculptors. Let us not only allow them to make their mark on campus, however impermanently; let us make it easy, and encourage and support them every step of the way.

2022-11-09,"My Fellow Freshmen, You Are Not Alone","
As we near the end of our first semester of college, first-year students may find themselves struggling. I know this feeling because I am feeling it myself. Despite the warnings, I don’t think any of us anticipated this year going by as fast as it is. The beginning of the week starts, and the next thing you know, it’s Sunday night, and we’re starting it all over again like clockwork. There seems to be little time for ourselves and I am here to tell you that you are not alone in your struggles.
In the rare event that I have no work, I find myself sitting somewhere on campus, whether in my room or Memorial Hill — contemplating what is to come. What does the future hold, here and beyond? Am I smart enough to face the real world? How different will next year be — and will I even be the same person? Will my friends still like me? And so many other questions that scare the hell out of me, but are necessary to ask. Whether or not you have caught yourself in moments like these, they are real questions, and it is okay to ask them.
For many of us, this is the first time we’re living on our own, away from our families, friends, and the people we have relied on our whole lives. College is meant to be hard. But that does not mean you can’t ask yourself those difficult existential questions. I have learned that asking the hardest questions about ourselves and our future yields the most rewarding results. College is a time when we learn who we are, what we want, why we want it, and the steps we must take to get there. People say that college is meant to be where we figure stuff out, but nothing actually prepares us for the figuring out process. We seem to be left to do it on our own.
I have heard people on campus questioning if they will even make it to graduation just because they didn’t do the best on their first midterm. I have talked to people who fear going out on the weekends because they think they’ll fall behind on their work. I know people who are afraid of making friends because they don’t want to push them away when things get rough, and people who are afraid of losing the friends they have made over the long breaks back home. There are so many emotions unraveling at this time of year, and it is okay to have them.
Nothing prepares us for how accelerated everything is in college. How does anyone have time for themselves when they have an essay due and have already asked for an extension? There are times when self-care may have to come later, but it’s crucial to make sure that it comes eventually. As the days grow darker and winter approaches, do not be afraid to seek the help you may not know you need to get through it all. If you have free time during the week, go somewhere you can sit and be at peace with yourself for a few minutes. Use the resources of the Counseling Center if you feel comfortable doing so. Talk to a trusted friend, whether that means someone here or from back home. Talk to a professor that you have a good relationship with. Write down how you feel; I used to journal, and even though I’ve fallen out of the habit, I remember how fulfilling it was to put my thoughts on paper, even if I was the only one reading them.
I know a lot of that sounds easier said than done. It has become easier for us to put on a facade, and hide our true feelings; we even hide them from ourselves sometimes. But, a lot of the time not everyone has it all together the way it may seem. It is easy to lose track of time in college and life. It is easier to think about what we want than to go for it. But I am here to tell you that when you find yourself in a place of distress or struggle, you are the only one that can get yourself out of it at the end of the day.
I am not writing this op-ed to tell anyone what to do or assume how anyone is feeling right now. I am writing to let you all know that you are not alone in any of your thoughts as we near the end of the semester. A lot of your friends may not tell you how they are feeling. Some people may not be struggling at all. But no one is alone in the general feelings of living and thriving in college. Sometimes knowing that we aren’t alone is enough.
While this is directed toward freshmen because it is our first experience here, every person on campus is not alone. While it may get easier as the years go on, we all need a reminder that someone else might feel the same way that we do. I am not a professional, but I am human, as we all are. So, the next time you wonder if you should take the extra five minutes in the shower, take ten. The extra set in the gym, do two. One more chapter of the book you're reading on the quad, read two. We can’t get any classwork done if we aren’t taking care of ourselves first.
Utilize the resources around you, and never blame yourself for asking the hard questions. Never lose yourself in pursuit of the goals we are told to have, and never forget that you aren’t alone."
2022-11-09,The Elite Student’s Struggle for Integrity,"
“History is a graveyard of classes which have preferred caste privilege to leadership.”
— E. Digby Baltzell
I’d like to start my argument with a single proposition: Every human being will, at some time or another, find themselves in a particular social context in which they must be courageous in pursuit of their own humanity. The farmer must choose to ethically raise his crops, even against the lure of higher profit. The politician must, with conviction, rise above the downward pull of greed and corruption in pursuit of justice. And we, the nation’s academic elite, must choose between the conventional trappings of success, on the one hand, and fulfillment, on the other.
If you’re anything like me, you spent the majority of your youth slowly moving toward the edge of the world. You performed. You competed. You excelled. But still, perhaps terrifyingly, you did not belong. You felt not unlike an orphan standing at society’s door, waiting anxiously to be let in. Then you got into Amherst, or Brown, or any other elite school for that matter, and suddenly the world was at your door, this time bearing gifts. It says to you, “Well look at that. Amherst! You made it, kid,” and proceeds to offer you all the status and wealth you could reasonably ask for. And who are we, we feel after a lifetime in exile, to say no to the world as it welcomes us with its deceptively open arms — the same way that storied witch welcomed Hansel and Gretel? What we do not see, at the precious age of 18 or 19 or 22, are the fangs lying behind society’s smile — that it does not have our best intentions at heart. What we do not see, to put it plainly, is that the world nourishes us only to then swallow us whole.
To put it all in concrete terms, I mean to say that we — and this is through no fault of our own — are blinded to the consequences of moving through elite pipelines. What we lose when we choose to go to law school, or medical school, or take a job at Goldman Sachs, simply because it is the path of least resistance, is often never articulated to us, but it is nothing less than a life worth living — a life of integrity, of humanity — a life of our own choosing.
It can seem as though the entire system that gets us into elite higher education, and which propels us forward into the pipeline professions, is designed to stop us from building our true selves. It is fundamentally conformist — and this is evidenced by the way many of us spent our high school, and still, perhaps, are spending our college years. We resumé pad, we grade grub, and we achievement hunt. We are told constantly, and begin to believe ourselves, that this makes us extraordinary. But conformity does not cease to be conformity simply because one is conforming to elite standards. The trouble, which still remains, is that these standards are not our own. They are Amherst’s. They are our parents’. They are McKinsey’s. But terrifyingly still, they are not ours.
Life itself is nothing less than a continuous process not of self-discovery, but of self-making. It is a process of creating one’s own set of standards, and living by them — growing ever more conscious, loving, and critical along the way. This, to me, is the fundamental human task. Society, then, seems to be one big conspiracy against the realization of our humanity — and this is, perhaps, especially true of our elite colleges. They corral us and funnel us into the most profitable, but often least fulfilling, professions. They advise us to be neglectful of the process of self-making in pursuit of wealth and status. It is, as one student at Yale put it, “stifling to the parts of yourself you’d call a soul.”
I mentioned firstly that every human being finds themselves in a particular social context which demands that they be courageous in pursuit of their own humanity. I’d like to remind us that this, as the academic elite and perhaps the future leaders of our nation, is ours: to choose lives of our own amid the pull of elite convention.
A Stanford student once posed a brilliant question. She asked: “What are the hidden incentives that are shaping the ways we dream?” It is high time we uncover these hidden incentives, and seek to change them, so that they no longer have power over us. What’s at stake here is nothing less than a life worth living."
2022-11-09,The Global Importance of Brazilian Democracy,"
Every four years, Brazil partakes in its two most important events: the soccer World Cup and the presidential elections. The World Cup is usually held in June, always in time to impact the elections, which happen in October; this year, however, due to Qatar’s extremely hot summer weather, the World Cup was postponed to December, so the elections happened first. On Sunday, Oct. 30, over 120 million Brazilians left their homes all over the world to cast their electronic ballots and decide their national leader for the next four years.
Among the many options we had during the first round of voting (which was held on Oct. 2), only the two most polemic candidates made it to the run-offs: Lula, who had already run for president five times between 1989 and 2006 and been elected twice, and Jair Bolsonaro, who was a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 1991 to 2018, only leaving to run for — and win — the presidency.
Since moving to the U.S., I have been asked about my opinions on President Bolsonaro countless times. His anti-Indigenous, sexist, homophobic, racist, climate change-denying and Covid-19 negationist views seem to have transcended the borders of Brazil, redefining our country’s image in both foreign and domestic ways.
Even after killing over 600,000 people by failing to determine lockdown measures, while also refusing to buy vaccines and getting involved in a R$40 billion (US$7.77 billion) corruption and bribery scandal, Bolsonaro is still extremely popular. His motto, “God, Country and Family,” was originally written by the National Fascist Party in 1931. As of today, it is acclaimed by Brazil’s enormous Christian population, who think Bolsonaro’s middle name, “Messias,” is a sign that he is the next Messiah to save our nation. When speaking to moderates, the polite way to refer to Bolsonaro’s political stance is “right-wing populism.” Those who are aligned with center-left or left-wing ideas would rather call him a fascist and even a genocidal mastermind. His supporters refer to him as “Captain” — the rank he held in the Army before attempting to bomb a military base — and “legend.” It is impressive Bolsonaro still has supporters, to say the least. But the source of his popularity finds itself in the other candidate.
In 2002, Brazil elected its first president hailing from the popular classes: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was born in the poor Northeast, only learning how to read at the age of 10, losing a finger in a factory while working at the age of 19 and becoming a sindical, or union, leader after that. Lula is seen both as a savior and as a menace. As president, he brought 25 million people out of hunger, and the number of university students rose from 3 to 8 million. A number of people view Lula as some kind of angel who was sent to save their lives.
However, corruption scandals such as Mensalão (during which R$101 million, around US$33 million at the time, was directed to pay deputies to the lower chamber in exchange for votes for Lula’s projects) and Petrolão (famously called the “Car Wash operation,” a bribery scandal involving around R$7 billion, or US$2.33 billion) harmed Lula’s image to an irreversible extent.
These scandals also culminated in a coup against fellow Workers’ Party member President Dilma Rousseff (2016), who was impeached due to fiscal pedaling with no constitutional justifications. Even despite these scandals, Lula was considered the only political force able to combat “Bolsonarism,” the near-cult movement that supports the current president and despises Lula with a passion.
Lula was reelected two weeks ago, though a considerable number of his votes came from people who claimed to be simply fighting for democracy and not for Lula himself. For the past years, Bolsonaro has been giving hints that he wanted to change the national voting system from electronic ballots to paper ballots after alleging fraud in this year’s election, and mentioned the possibility of calling for a third turn of elections if he didn't win the run-offs. On Election Day, the Federal Road Police blocked roads leading from poor towns and Indigenous communities to their voting sites: These groups are likely to vote for Lula, who is estimated to have lost around 200,000 votes due to this intervention. Right now, Bolsonaro’s supporters are again blocking roads and airports around Brazil while asking for “justice” in the electoral system and demanding the arrest of the president of the Supreme Electoral Court.
Brazilian democracy is threatened: After all, a significant number of Brazilian citizens (including me!) found themselves voting for a candidate only to avoid the other’s victory. When I talked to U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin with the Amherst Political Union a few weeks ago, he discussed how the U.S. is the largest democracy in the Western world right now. I asked about his thoughts on how the American democracy impacted other democracies in the West, but I also asked about the reverse: How do other big yet fragile democracies such as the one I was born in impact the one which I live in now? Raskin’s response was a confirmation that threats to democracy in any country also do threaten democracy in the U.S.; just as the American Revolution served as one of many inspirations for the French Revolution, and populism spread throughout Latin America because politicians could see it working in their neighboring countries, upheavals in world democracies often affect others like dominoes falling in a line. It is impossible for a democracy to exist independently, and each democracy helps sustain another by economic deals and political agreements.
I can see how democracies impact one another when my classmates ask me how things are going politically back in Brazil, or when the U.S. offers interventions or special representatives to check whether Brazil follows its interests or not. I also see how non-democracies impact one another when I see the rise of far-right wing movements across the world. Americas to Europe, and from Europe to the rest of the world.
I am extremely happy Lula won. I have my criticisms of him, but I also acknowledge that my ability to study abroad at Amherst is thanks to his policies and impact while he was president. His victory does not mean anyone should take their eyes off Brazilian politics or the paths current democracies around the world are taking, but at least Brazilians will get to enjoy the World Cup without another attempt at a coup d’etat, and maybe see Brazil conquer its sixth title. Or maybe not, depending on how Bolsonaro’s supporters and their own relationships to democracy might surprise us from now on."
2022-11-02,Restore the Student Activities Fee,"
A WAMH concert canceled, Senate projects a shadow of their former glory, club events with food nearly a bygone memory — the effects of the Association of Amherst Students (AAS) budget crisis have been deeply troubling. At only around halfway through the semester, the Senate has already exceeded its discretionary fund — the money set aside for clubs to dip into during the term — by $56,000, forcing it to draw from the Rainy Day Fund, its rapidly depleting piggy bank, which is on pace to bottom out in the foreseeable future. And while the Budgetary Committee has changed several policies to reduce expenditures, a more drastic step must be taken: It’s time to raise the student activities fee.
As it stands, the student activities fee costs each student $300 per semester, the sum of which is allotted for the AAS to distribute to student organizations, clubs, and special interest groups. The fee, which was eliminated during the off-campus period of the pandemic, has since been gradually increased, but is still well below its pre-pandemic level of $365.
Some students, especially those for whom paying tuition already poses a substantial burden, might be reasonably concerned about any increase to college’s comprehensive fee. However, it’s worth noting that the student activities fee makes up only 0.7 percent of the annual price to attend Amherst, and it’s one of the first costs covered by financial aid. It should also be noted that an increase of the fee by $100 per student — to $400 — would yield an addition to the AAS’ budget of nearly $200,000, undeniably netting a transformative difference in the college’s student life.
It wouldn’t be enough for the fee just to return to its absolute pre-pandemic level: Inflation must be taken into consideration. Last academic year, the college acknowledged that necessity when it increased the comprehensive fee by 4.5 percent, as stated in an email sent by former President Biddy Martin on March 11. The student activities fee should follow suit.
Furthermore, the AAS has been attempting to increase its spending caps alongside inflation, so that students are not forced to spend out of their own pockets to cover event costs, which would place an unfair economic pressure on students in club leadership positions, and may even make these positions inaccessible for some students. However, it’s easy to see that increasing spending caps to keep pace with inflation is an unsustainable policy if the AAS’ revenue remains static. In order to ensure equity, the college must ensure that the AAS is adequately funded.
The importance of raising the student activities fee goes beyond increasing the number of Insomnia cookies or Antonio’s slices the AAS is able to fund, though — it’s a matter of expanding students’ democratic power. Whether it is by providing club sports teams with the resources to train and compete, bankrolling free PVTA access for all students, or funding concerts and other events like prom, the AAS — as the only democratically elected body representing students — has a unique ability to fund the events, clubs, and programs that students actually care about.
Moreover, President Michael Elliott’s new administration has based much of its rhetoric on the notion of the liberal arts being essential to a healthy democracy. As one of the only sources of democratically controlled funding on this campus, the AAS budget embodies the college’s renewed mission, simultaneously ensuring that resources are allocated where students want them — allowing students to practice, as Elliott put it in his Opening Convocation speech at the start of the year, “democracy with a lowercase d.”
Now more than ever, as we move toward rebuilding post-pandemic, it’s important to think about where we, as a college, allocate our resources. Although it represents roughly 0.7 percent of the total annual cost of attendance, the student activities fee funds a huge portion of the events and institutions that create community on this campus.
While the Editorial Board acknowledges that we may not have a complete understanding of all the logistics of managing and distributing the budget, we think it imperative that the college’s policies reflect the times. To improve student life, ensure equity, and as a step toward the college’s renewed emphasis on democracy, we believe that the administration and the AAS must work together to increase the student activities fee to its pre-pandemic level, accounting for inflation. The wheels of progress are oiled only by collaboration.

2022-11-02,Let’s Talk About Israel and Palestine,"
I am a Zionist. Think about your reaction. Agreement? Disgust? Curiosity? When I call myself a Zionist, I mean that I believe the Jewish people should have a nation in the land of Israel. Some may think that as a Zionist, I must be anti-Palestinian. But that’s not the case. I firmly believe Palestinians should have a nation in the land of Palestine.
On this campus and many others, Jewish students who believe in self-determination for their own people are afraid to say so publicly for fear of backlash. Last year I spent four months doing research at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Most students talk about their study abroad with anyone who will listen, but I look over my shoulder anytime I’m about to bring it up. I’m concerned that others will make snap judgements about me just because I visited the Jewish state. Many feel the need to go even further: in a Brandeis Center survey, roughly half of Jewish college students reported at times hiding their Jewish, never mind Zionist, identity.
In order to have a respectful discourse on Israel-Palestine, we have to start by listening to each other’s narratives, something that can be painful and too easily derailed. Both Jews and Palestinians have a historical connection to the land, and their need for self-determination has been demonstrated by the way they have been treated in lands controlled by others.
The Jewish connection to the land dates back thousands of years, and Jews have maintained a presence there ever since we were exiled by the Romans nearly 2,000 years ago. Those of us in the diaspora pray facing Jerusalem, our holiest religious sites are there, and every year after our Passover Seder, we exclaim, “Next year in Jerusalem!”
I can only give my perspective and don’t presume to speak for Palestinians yearning for a state of their own. That being said, the Palestinian connection to the land dates back over a thousand years. Jerusalem is a place of religious significance for Muslim and Christian Palestinians. Many of the Palestinian refugees still have the keys to their homes in Israel proper, to which they hope to return.
The connections that both peoples have to the land are undeniable, and the distressing situations of each in lands controlled by others is proof of the need for a nation for both peoples.
Since being exiled from the land of Israel, Jews have faced persecution and expulsions in many of the places we’ve lived. This includes the expulsion of Jews in England, France, Spain, and Portugal in the Middle Ages, and the approximately 850,000 Jews expelled from Iraq, Libya, Morocco, and other Middle Eastern and North African countries in the 1940s-70s. From 1946 to 1948, the British interned more than 50,000 Holocaust survivors, fleeing to Mandatory Palestine, in detention camps in Cyprus, where 400 of them died. Ever since Jews rebuilt a state in their ancestral homeland, surrounding nations have invaded it many times, including in 1973 on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jews. Even in the U.S., antisemitic incidents made up more than half of religious based incidents of hatred in 2020, despite Jews only making up 2 percent of the population. Given this, having a state that Jews can turn to in times of need is critical.
Palestinians have also faced persecution living in lands controlled by others. From 2011 to 2020, Syrian forces killed over 3,000 Palestinians, nearly 500 due to torture. Palestinians born in Lebanon are denied work in dozens of professions, access to full health care, and education in Lebanese schools. In the West Bank, the Israeli government has restricted Palestinian movement so that they must go through checkpoints — where they face humiliation and abuse — in order to get to their jobs, visit family, and attend friends’ weddings. Shortly after Hamas, a U.S. and E.U. designated terrorist organization, seized power over Gaza in 2007, Israel and Egypt began enforcing a blockade there that monitors everyone and everything going in and out. This has led to high levels of unemployment, increased aid dependency for basic necessities, and limited ability to travel outside of Gaza. Palestinians living in Gaza, under Hamas, and parts of the West Bank, under the Palestinian Authority, have not had parliamentary or presidential elections since 2006, taking away even that measure of self-determination. Given their current situation, Palestinians also need a state that they can turn to. 
We must understand that not everyone who declares themselves pro-Palestine hates Zionists and not everyone who declares themselves a Zionist hates Palestinians. Let’s work toward a world where that is true of all people who call themselves pro-Palestine or Zionist. It begins with recognizing that both Jews and Palestinians have claims to the land of Israel and Palestine, and understanding that both need a nation that they can turn to in times of need. Once we agree on that, the hard work begins."
2022-11-02,Mass. Insider: On the Ballot,"
I have spent much time in this column writing about the Governor and Lt. Governor’s race — but let’s talk today about the other names lining the state ballot this cycle.
The most exciting part about this election cycle in the Commonwealth is that the nominees in five of the six statewide races are women. This is the first time Massachusetts has had this many women running for statewide office, and it’s about time. In fact, all six nominees would have been women if the almost 30-year incumbent State Secretary of the Commonwealth had not decided to run for yet another re-election.
In the Attorney General race, former Boston City Councilor and Council President Andrea Campbell reigned supreme in the Democratic primary. Many in Western Massachusetts political circles have argued that Ms. Campbell won the nomination only because gubernatorial nominee Maura Healey endorsed her in the lead-up to the primary — an argument which, given Campbell’s lackluster political record prior to this race, may not be too far off the truth.

Regardless of party endorsement, Campbell boasts a strong set of qualifications. According to the Berkshire Eagle’s endorsement, “Ms. Campbell’s resume includes time as a legal services attorney with EdLaw, an employment attorney, general counsel at the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, and legal counsel to Gov. Deval Patrick.” Her motivations for running for the state’s top law-enforcement position are clear, too: She often references the tragedy of her brother’s death while incarcerated, endowing her campaign with enormous meaning and drawing attention to the awful conditions endemic to the prison system. It’s clear Campbell is qualified for the job, but can she beat her opponent?
Campbell will face Republican Jay McMahon, who ran unopposed in his primary. A little-known name in politics, McMahon believes that there is too much “wokeness” in the Attorney General’s office. On his campaign website, he promises to, among other things, “initiate ‘Extreme Prosecution.’” According also to his website, “laws are supposed to prevent the bad guys from doing bad things. Therefore, laws that prevent good guys from doing lawful things do not reduce crime, they in fact enhance crime.” While researching and participating in state politics, I have never seen a campaign website as unserious and utterly ridiculous as this one. McMahon is dangerous, and if a candidate as unserious about the position as he is were to win the election, our Commonwealth’s future would be very dark indeed. Thankfully, according to a recent UMass Amherst poll, Campbell is expected to electorally annihilate McMahon 58 percent to 33 percent.
Next up, the State Auditor’s position. The State Auditor’s is perhaps the least known of the statewide offices, but its race is one of the most important. According to the Massachusetts Auditor’s website, “the Office of [the] State Auditor (OSA) conducts audits, investigations, and studies to promote accountability and transparency, improve performance, and make government work better.”
Boston area State Sen. Diana DiZoglio won the Democratic primary race for the Auditorship despite her lack of Democratic Party endorsement. Her opponent, Chris Dempsey, who has never held an elected office and is possibly most famous for having led the effort to keep the 2024 Olympics out of Boston, was endorsed by the current state auditor, Suzanne Bump, and won the state party endorsement in June. Dempsey won the party establishment endorsement, but DiZoglio triumphed.
DiZoglio spent most of her primary campaign appealing to young, progressive voters in the state and capitalizing on already being an elected official from eastern Massachusetts. DiZoglio made headlines in 2018 when she broke a non-disclosure agreement on the Massachusetts House of Representatives floor in order to make a statement against NDAs. Since then, she has advocated in the legislature to support victims of NDAs. One of her campaign pitches was that as Auditor, she would audit the Massachusetts Legislature to root out the apparent corruption — corruption like the silencing she faced when she had to sign her NDA years ago. More on her auditor plan can be found here.
In the general election, DiZoglio faces fellow Italian American Anthony Amore, the head of security for the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.
I have one of DiZoglio’s lawn signs on my lawn back in Springfield, and they are the biggest lawn signs I have ever seen. She told me a couple months back at an event that she wanted a picture of her on the lawn signs, so voters understood that she was the Italian “woman” in the race. I like Sen. DiZoglio a lot and believe that she will use the full power of the Auditor’s office to seek and root out the corruption and systemic injustices within our state agencies.
I only know a little about Amore. I have yet to see him at a single event in the western part of the state throughout this campaign season — a fact perhaps reflective of commonly-held perceptions of the region’s importance. To be fair and honest, I had no clue who Amore was until I had to look him up to write this. I fully support DiZoglio.
Finally, in the Treasurer’s race, Deb Goldberg is running for re-election. Her only opponent is a Libertarian nominee, and third parties, like in the rest of the country, do not stand a chance in Massachusetts. I fully support her return to the office.
Also on the ballot are four questions. YES on Question One would establish an additional 4 percent state income tax on annual taxable income exceeding $1 million. I am voting yes because I believe that the wealthy need to pay their fair share.
YES on Question Two would expand access to dental insurance throughout the state and help begin to close healthcare inequities. I am voting yes on question two.
YES on Question Three expands the ability of retailers to sell alcoholic beverages. I am leaving this question blank because I am not of drinking age. A NO vote would not change any alcohol-related laws in the state.
Finally, Question Four. YES on Question Four would allow undocumented immigrants to apply for and receive a driver’s license in the state of Massachuesetts. The Massachusetts legislature has already passed this law and it will take effect in July 2023. A yes vote would keep the law in place and a NO vote would repeal it. I believe in expanding access to citizenship and the resources one can receive under it, so I am voting yes on question four and encourage everyone else to do so as well.

2022-10-19,Editorial: Making J-Term Work,"

January Term (J-Term) as we know it is no more. The Ad Hoc Committee to Evaluate the January Term (J-Comm) delivered a report that was largely inconclusive on whether or not J-Term should continue, but stated that a solution to the various problems presented by J-term would need to be found before the program was approved. Most important of those problems was the massive logistical challenge the program posed to staff. Administrative staff generally use the winter term to support the transition between semesters, and the added workload of a miniature semester during the month is excessive. As a result, according to J-Comm’s survey, 26 percent of staff respondents answered “definitely not” when asked whether J-Term should continue in the future, the largest fraction out of any group.
This news is therefore perhaps saddest for students, over half of whom responded “definitely yes” when asked the same question. For students, the reasons for loving J-Term and wanting it to continue in some form were myriad: many of us liked the intensive class format, enjoyed the extra-long break — which could be spent either on campus or off — and appreciated the opportunity to take three classes in the spring semester. J-Term, in short, created a type of flexibility in student schedules that is impossible to reproduce within a strict two-semester system — it provided a boon to our mental health throughout the academic year.
While J-Term as it has been run for the past two years is likely not to come back anytime soon, it is also certain that on-campus activities during the winter break are positive for the student body. In the past, the Interterm program, which offered non-credit classes on everything from “Thai Cooking” to “Financial Bootcamps,” offered an experience less strenuous for academic staff, while still providing students with learning opportunities. However, J-Comm warned against a simple return to this programming. Positive memories of these experiences, the committee explained, are possibly simply reflections of the “pandemic’s collective trauma,” and “the Siren Song of Interterm is best left unheard.” However, the possibility of relatively unstructured programming with some of the same goals as those of Interterm, like preparing students for careers or teaching them skills that could be useful in further classes for a department, is too enticing to leave as a failed experiment.
As a 2019 report on Interterm suggests, it has been a difficult program to administer due to inconsistent student participation and burnout in the aftermath of the fall semester. However, over the last few years, winter break has been a week longer than it was in 2019, and that extra time in between semesters is valuable in enabling students to engage more fully with Interterm programming.
Winter term should be a time where experimentation is possible across campus. Faculty who are interested in providing winter opportunities for students — whether workshops for programs relevant to their field of study or field trips and other activities in the area — should be able to recruit students and apply for funding through an appropriate organization like the Center for Community Engagement or the Office of Student Affairs. These offices already administrate research programs through Gregory S. Call funding and work with the Loeb Center to offer opportunities like the college’s various career treks — longer versions of which could also be interesting to offer over January, especially if they could be hosted with local industries like agriculture and higher education.
Beyond just faculty-headed programs, the winter term is a perfect time for student organizations wishing to host their own opportunities. Any organization or group of students could apply for funding to host a winter-long book club, reading group, speaker series, or skill-based workshop. Then, students who want to engage more with their non-academic extracurriculars would be able to commit more time to them between terms in much the same way that athletes practice over winter or student researchers to further their projects.
The value of winter programming is manifold. The different kind of academic experience provided by a single intensive class is a valuable one in contrast to the semester’s workload — especially given the free time afforded by staying on campus over January. That free time speaks to a kind of camaraderie experienced by the suddenly-smaller campus. Friend groups switch around and coalesce in the smaller, quieter Val, and the compactness of our winter worlds makes this campus feel truly tight-knit in a way it can’t in the semester.
It is true that it will always be a logistical challenge to support any number of students on campus over the January term. As J-Comm’s report says, the college “isn’t staffed or budgeted for the 24/7/365 operations which it has grown into.” Until this essential issue of proper operational preparation is solved, any activities beyond those of the semesters themselves will be prohibitively difficult. The potential of student-led programming, among the other opportunities that various members of the college community want to explore, is so high that finding a solution to those questions is imperative. Winter term is too valuable to let fall away due to these unresolved concerns, and every effort should be made by every party to make winter programming a reality.

2022-10-19,Kayah’s Korner: How To Navigate Office Hours,"
Anonymous asks, “How do you make conversation with a professor during office hours?”
Dear Anonymous,
When I set foot on the Amherst College campus, I knew that I needed to go to office hours. It was an opportunity that had been stressed to me during Summer Bridge, a program that aims to help first-generation, low-income students transition to Amherst a few weeks before the start of their first year. Students in the program take four courses over the span of four weeks, classes that mirror the rigor of a typical semester-long Amherst College course. Summer Bridge office hours took place with professors who were aware of our socioeconomic status and general lack of familiarity with the space, but when the year started, I realized that not all office hours are like this — and many professors expect students to already be aware of this fact.
I will never forget the moment I hopped onto the virtual office hours Zoom link for one of my foreign language classes. It was, to put it generously, brutal. My professor and I exchanged greetings in Spanish before the conversation fell awkwardly into silence. The discomfort was only intensified by the two screens existing between us, each of us waiting for the other person to say something first. What the professor didn’t know was that I had spent the last three weeks in office hours where Summer Bridge professors had prompted me and created topics for conversation, often framing the time as an informal space to catch up.
I learned the hard way that this is not characteristic of all office hours. I wish someone had told me what to expect. Instead, I found myself scrambling for generic questions to ask my foreign language professor. If you, like me, find yourself new to a class and unsure how office hours work, I would recommend three things:
The first recommendation is to play to your strengths. Is there a specific quote from the text or concept from the class that struck you? Perhaps you can articulate why this stood out to you. Why did it feel important? Do you see it connecting to work in your other classes and/or, perhaps, your lived experience? Is there a final assignment that you could see this connection fitting into? Invite your professor to provide you with additional material that addresses the theme or concept you’re attracted to — content that is extracurricular to the syllabus. Ask them if there will be an opportunity to explore this topic further in the class, and — if there won’t be — if they will generate opportunities for such exploration. This approach has the additional effect of introducing your professor to your interests and how you, specifically, synthesize things. Professors frequently enjoy matching students to opportunities on campus that they see fitting a student’s interests, and these opportunities often come with funding.
My second suggestion is somewhat opposite to my first: Address your points of difficulty. Note passages in the text or questions from the homework that were particularly difficult for you. Also spend time trying to understand why you’re struggling with them. Is there a particular component of the argument or step in the solution process that trips you up from understanding the rest of the assignment? Does the author do a poor job of considering the lived experience of the demographic group to which they’re referring? Is the argument unclear and packed with jargon? Does the author’s argument hinge on assumptions that they don’t care to unpack? These are questions to consider as you read, and you can note any gaps you saw in the text — in either the content itself or in how you understood it — to discuss with your professor. Or perhaps you want more general tips about organization and time management for a particular course. Is your history course packed so full of reading that you aren’t sure where to begin or how to read for the class? In some cases, your professor is aware of how heavy the workload is and can suggest study strategies that were particularly useful for them or that accommodate your specific learning style. In other cases, the professor hasn’t yet heard that their course work is unmanageable and will consider adjusting the schedule to accommodate the needs of that specific class at that specific moment.
My last piece of advice is to introduce yourself to the professor by offering anything you feel comfortable sharing that they might not already know. For instance, as a low-income student, I have spent many semesters working upwards of 20 hours (and sometimes full-time), which is an extenuating circumstance that the professor should be made aware of. Or perhaps you filled out accommodations, but want to explain your preferences and set of circumstances to the professor yourself, in a private space. Remember that you belong at this institution because you got in, and that the institution has a responsibility to help you understand that and meet you wherever you’re at.
One final note: Professors also love to share things about themselves! Feel free to look at a faculty bio and follow up with the professor about their research in office hours. They spend their time outside of the classroom dedicating their lives to these topics, so it’s often rewarding for them to be able to share that with you.
But at the end of the day, remember that office hours are your time. Office hours are what you make of them. Whatever you feel pressed to discuss in that time is yours to share in the way that you feel most comfortable.
Sincerely,
Mikayah"
2022-10-19,"A Tribute to My Dear Friend, Franklin Odo","
That smile. When I recall my friend and mentor Franklin Odo, it is his omnipresent smile that I picture: a big inviting grin. It is hard now to imagine walking through Morgan Hall without seeing it. For his smile didn’t just cheer you up on the gloomiest of cold New England February mornings (we get a lot of those here); it also embodied his welcoming and uplifting presence. He both pulled you in with his warmth and generosity and held you up in a net of support that spanned generations, encompassing scores fortunate enough to have been graced by his care. He advised and mentored countless undergraduates, graduate students, activists, organizations, scholars, and even prospective Amherst students over the course of his life. Because his impact was so broad and sustained, outpourings of shock and grief have rippled across my social media feeds since his passing a few weeks ago.
I had known of Franklin Odo the figure, a leader in the field of Asian American studies, for years, but came to know Franklin Odo the person while working with a group of scholars for the National Park Service on developing a theme study for Asian American and Pacific Islander history. It was a daunting and troubling task — jamming centuries of histories of disparate peoples into a workable and limited frame. We managed in large part due to his engaging leadership, steady demeanor, and his characteristic unflagging energy. Did he ever stop? I recall chasing him through the Metro during a field trip to Washington, D.C., after a snowstorm, careful not to get ditched as he scurried through the hordes of commuters.
He was also a connector: bringing people in communion, as on that D.C. field trip where nearly 20 students from the Five Colleges were graced with a private tour of a new Smithsonian exhibit. . I’d known he would bring those qualities to Amherst, but I never imagined that he would have such an impact during his too-few years here. He quickly made connections throughout the Five College community with numerous staff, faculty, alumni, and most of all, with students, for whom he was a beloved mentor, respected elder, and trusted confidant. I joked with him that he was the gift that kept on giving. Did he ever say no? Not to anyone I know.
As an activist, teacher, scholar, public historian, and leader for over half a century, Franklin Odo committed himself broadly to justice and specifically to establishing a place for Asian American narratives in the national story. He was there in the nascent days of protest and possibility, and soon became an internationally recognized figure. After building programs in academe, he made the uncharacteristic transition to public history, becoming the founding director of the Smithsonian’s Asian Pacific American Center. Over the years, he became a polestar for generations inside and outside academe, often helping you without you ever knowing. His formidable career, coupled with his self-possession, humility, and aloha spirit reminded many they had a place in the most elite spaces and could shape them while remaining themselves. He also reminded us how much our stories matter — to us and to the nation — and of the responsibilities we have as stewards of them.
In one of those many social media posts I’ve been seeing in recent weeks, someone described Franklin Odo as like a stream: clear and consistent, which he was. But being both a water lover and witness to his many contributions, I saw him more as a whole ecosystem — a Great Lake maybe, given all that he supported and nourished over generations.
One of his grieving former students sent me a message after his passing: “He left me no guidebook.” I tried to assure her that he did — in how he lived. In his copious curiosity, unwavering care for others, and lifelong commitment to community. All of which was in that smile."
2022-10-19,The Case for Mask-optional Classrooms at Amherst,"
On March 9, 2020, Amherst College became one of the first schools in the country to cancel in-person classes and move to online learning, even though not a single case of Covid had been detected on campus. At the time, this decision seemed like an over-reaction and prompted considerable criticism by many students and families.
Although Amherst’s decision initially appeared somewhat rash, its wisdom quickly became clear. And as an Amherst professor, I felt proud that we were one of the first colleges to make the difficult choice to send students home. We were making decisions guided by science — and moving to online learning that spring clearly did save lives.
For the next two years, science continued to guide campus policies. Throughout the 2021-2022 academic year, Amherst set strict rules for all members of the campus community: full vaccination (including the booster), weekly testing, and wearing a KN95 mask in all classrooms. Once again, I felt pride — and relief — when talking to colleagues who taught at other schools, whose students were not required to be vaccinated and who were unable to insist on masks even in their own classrooms.
But as of Oct. 17, our official Covid policy, in which mask requirements are determined based on anonymous voting, is clearly not based on science.
The new policy is — of course — absurd. It means some students might attend three of their classes without wearing a mask, and wear a mask in their fourth. It means that students eat all of their meals in a crowded campus dining hall, and may then pull out a mask to wear in class. Perhaps most importantly, it means that the preferences of a single (perhaps anxious, perhaps hypochondriac) student take priority over perhaps equally valid preferences from their peers, who might struggle with hearing their professor’s voice through a mask or understanding explanations when facial expressions are hidden. This policy seems especially unwarranted given scientific data showing that well-fitting KN95 masks provide excellent protection to the wearer, allowing high-risk community members to protect themselves even when others around them are unmasked. And on a campus in which all students, faculty, and staff are all required to be vaccinated and boosted, the risk of serious consequences from Covid infection is extraordinarily low.
Most faculty are quite ready for the mask requirement to end. So why does this policy continue? In meeting after meeting, only a few faculty voices are heard — and those voices are loudly and vehemently calling for the policy to continue. These loud voices create the perception that these views are more common, and more fully accepted, than they actually are. This condition, in which a majority of group members privately hold one belief but incorrectly assume that most others feel differently, is known as pluralistic ignorance.
Pluralistic ignorance occurs in part because we form norms based on public expressions, even when these statements do not reflect most group members’ private beliefs. For example, an in-depth study of a small Methodist community in the 1930s found that a vocal minority led to the perception of strong community norms against gambling, drinking, and smoking, even though most residents were both supporting and engaging in such activities. Similarly, research shows that most college students feel personally uncomfortable with excessive alcohol use on campus, but believe that other students are perfectly comfortable with the amount of drinking.
Given our innate human drive to feel connected to others in our social group, most people hesitate to express views that challenge the perceived norm — even if that norm is wrongly believed to be far more widespread than it actually is. Why is it so hard to challenge members of our community? Research in neuroscience reveals that our tendency to conform to the norms of our social group is hardwired into our brains. For virtually all of us, it is far more comfortable to fit in than to stand out — which helps explain why I, along with most of my like-minded colleagues, stay silent when the mask policy is discussed in faculty meetings.
But here’s the good news: As I’ve discovered in my own research on social norms, often conducted in collaboration with my Amherst thesis students, educating people about the errors we so often make in perceiving these norms helps reduce such misunderstandings. Most importantly, explaining the psychological processes that lead us to misperceive what those around us are actually thinking — to believe that most students are comfortable with the amount of alcohol use on campus or that most faculty are in favor of a classroom mask requirement — can help us resist the pressure to stay silent in the face of a small but vocal minority in all sorts of situations — with friends, with teammates, and even with faculty colleagues.




"
2022-10-19,What I Wish I Knew About Studying Abroad,"
When it comes to studying abroad, I think that the U.S. has some very real misconceptions about the entire process. From what I’ve gathered, many people assume that once you commit to a program, you will proceed to embark on a larger-than-life journey to the country of your dreams, where you will spend the entire semester partying, sight-seeing, and occasionally attending class—and then return many months later a changed person with, if you’re lucky, a foreign romance story to tell.
That has not been my experience.
I have been living abroad in Spain now for a little over a month, and the adjustment has been anything but easy. In the short time that I’ve been here, I have had to adapt to an entirely new culture, rewire my brain to a different language, alter my sleep schedule, navigate a foreign school system, make friends, and much more. There are so many aspects to being here that I wish I had known about prior to leaving the U.S.
First of all, though this might sound naive, I was taken aback at the sheer number of cultural barriers that exist between the United States and Spain. There are so many subtle differences between our two countries that I couldn’t have possibly prepared myself for before arriving. For instance, if you want to ride the metro here, you have to physically open the doors yourself in order to enter. It took me a few minutes of wandering aimlessly along the metro platform, wondering how so many train doors could possibly be malfunctioning at once, before I realized my mistake.
Additionally, unlike what some people might tell you, studying abroad can actually be incredibly isolating. In my head, I had this silly fantasy that, once I arrived in Spain, I would immediately become friends with the other students in my program — at the very least, I thought that having a common nationality would unite us.
But finding my place amongst this group has been unforeseeably challenging. Since I’m participating in a program run through a specific “host” university, the majority of the people in attendance are students from that school who already know one another. Unlike me, they have long-standing relationships with each other, and it feels awkward to try to insert myself into their lives, especially in my non-native language.
Still, in my opinion, the most complicated, uncomfortable, and ostracizing part of the entire abroad experience is, — and no surprise here, — money. (As The Wu-Tang Clan once so eloquently put it, cash truly does rule everything around us.)
Every weekend, the majority of my program’s members pack up their things, hop on a plane or bus, and then take a vacation to some beautiful (but pricey) European landmark that I would love to visit with them but can’t afford. The thing that frustrates me the most isn’t the fact that I don’t have the same amount of money in my bank account or even that these students are taking regular trips; discrepancies between class and socioeconomic status have always existed in a capitalistic society and will most likely persist for generations to come. (And I do have some plans to travel alone, staying in hostels and taking the cheap red-eyes.) What I can’t stand is the fact that I’m missing out on these bonding opportunities with the other students, who seem to be making core memories and building friendships on these weekly excursions together, while I, on the other hand, am not.
And, to clarify, it’s not like any of my peers are doing anything wrong or outwardly disrespectful. If they want to take trips on the weekends, they should be able to, and it’s none of my business. In fact, some of them have even invited me to join in on their excursions, which is thoughtful. However, because I cannot afford the Airbnb’s, the airplane tickets, the food, and all of the other small traveling fees, I always have to decline, making my chances of being asked again increasingly less likely. Instead, I have to be content with knowing that while they are off in some incredible new city, I made the “non-choice” choice to stay behind and work — that I can only live vicariously through their many Instagram posts.
This isn’t to say that I am not enjoying being in Spain or that I don’t feel like I am gaining something valuable from the experience. I would still highly recommend a semester abroad, and I already have a long list of unforgettable experiences that I’ve stored away in my brain. Still, I do wish I had known a little bit more about what exactly I was getting myself into before I said goodbye to my friends, my family, and my home. More importantly, I wish that I had been able to see that leaving the U.S. didn’t mean leaving behind its societal inequities.
I guess I’ll just have to wait and see how this semester unfolds. I am, after all, only a month into this entire experience. Instead of worrying about what the other people in my program are doing, I’m going to focus on what I can control: myself. Because, at the end of the day, I am still in Spain. And, who’s to say what the future holds? Maybe a European love story is still in the cards for me … your guess is as good as mine."
2022-10-19,Mammoth Mind-Pho-ness: Clean Up Your Drive Storage!,"
In 2021, Google announced that starting July 2022, it would be putting an end to free, unlimited storage for all Google Workspace customers, comprising a large number of its higher education clients. The company imposed a new 100 TB cap on pooled storage for those clients on the most basic of the new Workspace plans, forcing institutions who rely on Google’s cloud storage to evaluate and make changes to their data storage practices rapidly.
Schools affected by the change have responded in different ways. Select institutions, like NYU, partnered with Google to negotiate an extension until July of 2024, giving those universities enough time to reassess suitable communication e-tools to support their research, academic, and administrative needs as well as developing a well-rounded technology solution for their community.
Case Western Reserve University published an article under the UTech News page on its website detailing how Google’s new policy works and urging the community to begin to cut back its reliance on Drive storage by 75 percent at the earliest possible time.
In South Korea, higher institutions like Yonsei University, Kyung Hee University, and Korea National Open University took prompt action. In a Facebook post, Yonsei told students and affiliates to free up space in their account so that their total would be 20 GB before Oct. 4, 2022. This total is not limited to Google Drive, but also includes Gmail, and Google Photo files. After the deadlines, accounts that exceed allowed capacity will be blocked from logging in and receiving emails. For those who wonder if Shared Drive will be a likely option, the university responded that the “Shared Drives” function would disappear. In addition, the university understood its tight announced deadlines, and thus offered students extensions to clear up their spaces through different rounds of signup on a Google Form.
In addition to making a similar announcement, Korea University already made a transition to NAVER WORKS, a South Korea-based search engine which promises each student 30GB of storage. Meanwhile, Seoul National University still plans to stick to Google by purchasing a license to use Google Workspace for Education Plus, which allegedly will cost the school more than 100 million won (approximately $70,000) a year. Overall, universities in South Korea learned that nothing was for free, even with Drive.
Meanwhile, Amherst College hasn’t issued any official statement regarding Google’s new policies. But according to the school’s website, the college has been operating its collaborative platform on G Suite for Education, now known as Google Workspace for Education. This suggests that we will be impacted by Google’s future cap of 100 TB.
At the same time, another article by Carly Walker provided reasons why higher institutions need a Google Workspace for Education audit at least every two years, urging the IT Specialist Team of each college to check administrative settings and map out Google’s domain services to solidify the system and better curate it for space-saving purposes. Documentations of the audit team’s progress can help IT Specialists of these clients look into deeper problems of the system.


Recently, I went to the first floor of Seeley Mudd to meet with one of the specialists at the Information Technology (IT) Department. He told me that Amherst College shouldn’t be impacted much by the policy change, meaning students will still have access to unlimited storage until we graduate. When I asked him why we received such special treatment, he pointed at the perks of being a small college. Compared to NYU’s massive student population, Amherst has way fewer students, for whom Google’s calculated space for “approximately over 100 million documents, 8 million presentations, or 400,000 hours of video” is more than enough. In addition, he said that the college could scale to “get students accommodated” should the institution exceed its cap. The specialist also suggested that in comparison to Dropbox, Google Drive was more disorganized in folder structures, but was doing better at enabling sharing access among members in the organization. This may lead to an eventual move away from Dropbox to Drive, due to the culture of working together across shared files at Amherst.
Until then, we don’t know what other limits will prevent us from storing files and photos that we deem necessary, including those that serve work purposes or hold emotional value for us. So, what can we do to preserve our files?
Consider other storage options like Dropbox. Amherst College is currently supporting this application. Reach out to the IT Specialists Team (or run over to Seeley Mudd where they’re based) to get an invitation to join Dropbox.
For now, create a second Google account. With a username following a format like [firstname][lastname][email protected] or any customized format, this seems to be an ideal workaround for this current crisis. You will be given 15 GB, so try to only “archive” what you really need. Here’s a tip: For each categorized folder of backed up items, create a text file outlining what these items are and why they go under the same folder. As someone who was on the lookout for a safe haven for my files, I often rushed the process and ended up confusing which folder held which files. A note to remind me why I had a certain way of ordering the files in a given folder would come in handy for my goldfish memory.
Post photos of special moments to social media so that you have a social copy of them. Worried if they come at the cost of your privacy? Enable Private Mode. If you happen to be storing photos and videos for a project, get your feet on it right now! It can be hard to let go, but rethink what’s important to you, and delete the rest. Scale up the situation a bit: if you were in a fire, what would you bring with you on your escape? Asking that question multiple times might help.
In line with Amherst College’s Electronic Resources Acceptable Use Policy, members are to use e-resources that may be used only for the purposes authorized by the College. These purposes are believed to be related to “work, study, research, service, or student residential activities consistent with the College's mission and priorities.” Although storing photos of quality time with family and hangouts with friends in the school account is prevalent among college students, saving only documents that abide by the college’s original policy significantly helps in this context of Drive reduction.

2022-10-13,Toward a Cuisine of Cultural Representation,"
Three Mondays ago, struck by an immense craving, I was tearing my hair out writing an opinion piece that petitioned for the appearance of pho — an internationally-acclaimed dish that speaks for Vietnam’s history and cuisine — on the Val menu. My right hand was tapping away at my Macbook’s keys (mainly “delete” because I felt like my sentences weren’t making sense, I was so hungry!) while my left hand was scrolling through Val’s menu for the day. Then, I saw it: Pho. On the Val menu. For dinner.
I sat through my classes impatient and restless, waiting for 5 p.m. to finally come and Val’s doors to finally open. After rushing through Val’s back doors and swiping in, I was dumbfounded at the long lines (not one, but two) for the “Traditional” section. Everyone was excitedly chatting about the new noodle dish being served for dinner. I was curious and eager to get my long-awaited pho. But my curiosity soon became knitted brows. Taking a peek behind the shoulder of the person in front of me, I was filled with confusion about what had been advertised as my homeland’s signature dish.
Let me go through the stages of making my bowl of “pho” at Val:
Back at my table, I stared at the bowl for a good 10 seconds. The last time I had pho was when I was in South Korea last year. It was normal pho with yellow radish and kimchi as banchan on a separate plate. That time I could still tell that I was eating pho, just with a Korean touch — the variations on the dish seemed to be culinary artistry to me, speaking to the creativity of the chef.
I still remember being so pumped at the sight of pho on Val’s menu, immediately messaging my friend who had never tried Vietnamese food before. I was so hopeful for Val’s pho to leave him a good impression of this dish I took immense pride in. But the moment I was presented with something that was titled “Pho” in the dining hall that night, I immediately wanted to take back my words. It was not PHO!
I was not initially upset with Val’s different take on pho. Instead, I was happy that my culture was acknowledged and celebrated in this semester’s new menu. However, my joy began to fade as soon as I tasted the dish. The flavors of Val’s pho failed to bring to mind the culture that I grew up in, betraying my confidence in the message behind the dish. Instead of satisfaction at the end of my dinner, all I was left with was disappointment.
Pho was born during the 20th century wartime in Vietnam. It can be said that Pho has stood the test of time — it has survived through national loss, suffering, and political turmoil, and it encompasses the culture of Vietnam. It is not a “new ramen” — it is central to our identity. A good pho is founded first upon a solid beef broth, with beef meatballs and beef slices to serve as toppings. Nevertheless, without vegetables, the dish loses its heart and soul. The best vegetables to pair with pho are generally things like bean sprouts, mints, cilantro, Thai basil, sliced jalapeno peppers, and lime wedges.
An interesting aspect of pho is that although it is globally treated as a Vietnamese signature dish and it really is, its way of making was developed from a classic French stewed beef dish called pot-au-feu — its phonetics even bears a resemblance with Pho. Furthermore, the dish is widely believed to have been largely inspired by Chinese and Taiwanese beef noodle soup. In this case, the original name 牛肉粉 (niu rou fen) has the character 粉 (fen), which also possesses a high similarity with pho.
The uncanny connections with other cultures is what makes pho accessible. It paves the way for Vietnam in integrating into a global community. At the same time, because of its multicultural characteristic, there seems to be no real pho, at the end.
In Vietnam, we have an unsettled debate between the North and the South on which pho is the best. In this sense, pho has become a national political object that represents the divide between two regions. Despite differences in the transparency of the broth and the side dishes used in the two areas, however, their original ingredients remain unchanged: marrow-rich beef bone broth, fresh-cut bite-size rice noodles, cilantros, and onions. I hope that, while making changes to this tasty dish, people still retain a part that belongs to our history. It is our ancestors’ wish when they name it phở.
Even though I was disappointed that night, I believe that the future can still be bright for pho at Val. Brainstorming daily dishes and feeding some two thousand students is a task only made possible by the tireless and loving efforts of Val staff.
At the same time, the administration at Val shouldn’t call this “pho.” There clearly are not a lot of Vietnamese students at the college, but that doesn’t mean they are not there, and they can tell this is not what they eat at home. Labeling it as phở opens the dish up to certain expectations. If you know you cannot get a close version of something, you should not not outright label it as if it is the authentic one. Doing that does not only affect the image of phở, but simultaneously places the ingredients used, in this case ramen and soba, in a dark shade. They belong to another culture, and using them to recreate a dish of a foreign culture misrepresents their identity.
On a positive note, I think that because Val already gave pho its day one, it can only improve on days two, three, four, and so on. I firmly believe that things can always get better through a collective effort.
The college, when it wants to introduce dishes from a new cuisine to better represent its diverse population, must therefore create a dialogue with students whose culture is represented by that cuisine. Action based on these conversations is the only way to get to a point where the dishes served at Val represent the students they claim to represent, and the only way to create a more truly inclusive environment in the dining hall."
2022-10-05,Say Yay to Mountain Day,"
While Amherst students rued the unfortunate cancellation of Farm Fest this past week, students at two of our fellow Five Colleges, Smith and Mount Holyoke, enjoyed a particularly exciting treat in the form of Mountain Day.
For those not in the know, Mountain Day is a tradition held by a couple of different colleges across the U.S. wherein classes, extracurriculars, and other responsibilities are canceled without warning and students climb whatever mountain is convenient and relatively close to their campuses. While Mountain Day is named for and centered around this climb, the colleges that celebrate it treat it as a day to engage in outdoor activities in general: Smith encourages apple picking and picnicking opportunities, Mount Holyoke serves ice cream on the mountain, and Williams has had all-campus picnics and polar bear swims.
Considering that two of the Five Colleges and our dearest rival have Mountain Day, why don’t we? You obviously don’t need a mountain to hold Mountain Day (re: Smith) — and besides, we’re the College on the Hill, in the middle of a Pioneer Valley filled with extremely hikeable mountains.
For a campus so surrounded by beautiful natural landmarks, Amherst’s culture is remarkably inward-looking, and the majority of students spend most of their time within the Amherst bubble. It is too common a phenomenon for students here to look up from their notebooks and realize that they haven’t left campus proper in four weeks — we often marinate in the pressures and stresses of campus, and the repetitiveness of our travels between class, dorm, and dining hall only exacerbate academic burnout. A physical relocation, with new sights and sounds and smells, is often surprisingly and enormously beneficial for a person’s psyche. Mountain Day would give students a chance not only to purposely break out of that bubble, but to reconnect themselves with the natural landscape in a way that many students, the Editorial Board included, just don’t feel able to justify with our busy schedules.
The unscheduled nature of Mountain Day is particularly important here. If we had a scheduled day off, many people would surely plan out hangouts with their friends or work they’re planning to do or events to go to in advance before they would consider school-sponsored outside time. But the unexpected nature of Mountain Day encourages widespread participation in the festivities, allowing more people to actually get outside. Moreover, there is a kind of symbolic power to summiting a mountain, and a change in perspective that makes all of our homework seem so much smaller, so much farther away. Up in the clouds, the worldly concerns weighing on us may disappear.
Mountain Day brings students in touch with nature and helps build community among the student body — after all, what’s more of a bonding experience than climbing a mountain with several of your peers? There are so few events that we as a campus participate in collectively, and Mountain Day is an opportunity to bring the student body closer together. Also, the Pioneer Valley is arguably at its best in the fall: just consider all the fun fall activities to do here.
While the logistics of Mountain Day may seem daunting at first, we can easily follow our fellow colleges’ approaches. Amherst could provide shuttles to the mountain, as Mount Holyoke does, and those who would rather carpool on their way there could choose to do so. From there, students could choose to hike up the mountain or continue with the shuttle to the top, if they had accessibility concerns or simply didn't enjoy hiking. Depending on the mountain we pick, Amherst could also create activities and events centered around the day: Mount Tom, for instance, has its own ice cream shop near the bottom as a fun reward for triumphant students, but for those who would rather have little to do with the mountain, there could be shuttles to other outdoorsy activities, like apple picking, rafting, a brunch picnic, and many more.
Considering the uproar in the aftermath of the cancellation of Farm Fest, it’s obvious that Amherst students do appreciate nature when it’s accessible for them. Mountain Day would undeniably be a success. And — let’s be real — there are so few campus-wide Amherst traditions that the entire school truly takes part in. Let’s grab some inspiration from our fellow schools and make some of our own.
Unsigned editorials represent the views of the majority of the Editorial Board — (assenting: 22; dissenting: 0; abstaining: 0)."
2022-10-05,The Case for Five Class Slots,"
Another semester, another add/drop period gone by, with course registrations just around the corner. As we gear up for another round of stressing over class selections, I’d like to consider the question that constantly strikes my mind as I stare longingly at my registration screen: Why do Amherst students only have four course slots a semester?
While taking five classes is possible here, Amherst makes it unnecessarily difficult for students to do so through its permission system. Currently, in order to take five courses, you have to justify your reasoning and receive extra advisor and class dean approval — approval that is sometimes excessively difficult or impossible to get. From stories I’ve heard from my peers, some advisors heavily discourage or outright don’t allow their students to take more than four classes, citing a student’s perceived inability to handle them. This unnecessary and sometimes impassable hurdle makes it difficult for students to even consider taking five courses.
The reason why Amherst institutes this permission system is obvious: We don’t want already stressed students to feel that they need to take more classes to demonstrate their ambition or intelligence to their peers. The current system simply doesn’t make five classes a feasible schedule for many students, and if we want to make five class slots a reality, we will have to change that system.
First, let me address the reasons why having five class slots can be better. For one, taking five classes allows students to better take advantage of the school itself. Amherst has an incredible course catalog, filled to the brim with learning opportunities in any (well, almost any) subject you can imagine, and an open curriculum to facilitate taking advantage of that variety. It’s no surprise that students would want to take as many classes as it is possible for them to handle given such a curriculum. But in our current system, people who are double majoring or planning on studying abroad often have little time to explore courses outside of their majors. Allowing people to take five classes would facilitate the mission that Amherst is trying to achieve with its open curriculum.
Also, taking five classes simply looks more competitive to outside institutions. Prospective employers comparing the transcript of an Amherst student with four classes and another student with five classes may be incentivized to look more kindly upon the latter simply because they’ve taken eight more classes throughout their college career (and thus have eight more classes’ worth of knowledge and skills).
Under the current four class slot system, the majority of our “learning” is centered not in class time, which is typically only three hours a week per class, but in what Amherst calls “academic engagement,” consisting of labs, discussion sections, studios, or good old homework, for nine hours a week (a figure that may or may not represent reality). For someone taking five courses, that’s an estimated 60 hours of work weekly, taking up more than one-third of your week. But if we lower the amount of additional academic engagement hours to, say, six to seven hours a week, then someone taking five courses would have about 45-50 hours of work a week — 15 hours in class and 30-35 hours of outside work — a similar number to the 48 hours of work someone enrolled in four courses would currently have.
To be clear, I am not advocating for a drastic decrease in the 48 hours of work we get overall — that’s an article for a different day perhaps — but rather for a decrease in the workload per class in order to make space for one more slot. One consequence of this is that we would spend more time in class overall, but I don’t see that as a bad trade-off at all: I think face-to-face interaction with a professor is actually much more beneficial than homework to the learning process. When I reflect back on the new things I’ve learned in college and carry forward with me, the majority of that learning stemmed from class, not from the readings and forum posts I did in preparation for said class.
I’m not denying that homework does have an important role in building upon and shaping our in-class learning — I just think our educational system should maximize rather than minimize the number of in-class hours we have, and distribute homework accordingly. A concern some people have with adding more class slots and reducing the amount of homework assigned per class is that teachers won’t be able to dive as deeply into certain topics as they do currently. But less homework doesn’t mean less learning, it just means that professors have to rethink the way they currently structure classes so that students can get the most out of class time (a task, I’m sure, they’re already optimized to do).
We don’t have to look far to find other schools implementing this system; there are already numerous examples among our peer institutions, including Yale, Columbia, and Bowdoin. All of these institutions have five class slots as the “average” number of classes a student takes per semester. Students are managing to maintain a work-life balance with five classes instead of four, surely because their academic workload is set up by their college in a way to facilitate that.
In registering for my Spring 2023 courses, I’m sure I’ll have to undergo the very same debate with my advisor about wanting to take five classes that I’ve undergone every semester (if you’re reading this, I know you do it out of care for me; don’t worry Professor). But hopefully, future students won’t have to go through that song-and-dance.

2022-10-05,UMass Dining: A Comprehensive Review,"
Amherst College is not known for its food. UMass Amherst, on the other hand, recently earned the distinction of having the country’s Best Campus Food, according to the Princeton Review. UMass is no stranger to this award; 2022 marks the sixth consecutive year that they have topped the rankings. So, with the country’s best dining hall food just a five-minute drive from Amherst’s campus, what student wouldn’t be curious as to what makes UMass the king of college dining? And, more importantly, is the food as good as everyone says it is? Last Friday, two of my fellow gastronomes and I decided to try it for ourselves.
To gain access to the Berkshire Dining Commons — one of UMass’s four dining halls — one either has to pay $17 per person or find a UMass student who is willing to part with one of their “Guest Swipes.” After ruling out the first option, my friends Joe Sweeney ’25, Ziji Zhou ’25, and I loitered outside the entrance before intercepting three freshmen who generously agreed to swipe us in. (Useful tip: Freshmen are more likely to have remaining “Guest Swipes” than upperclassmen.) And with that, the cornucopia that is the Berkshire Dining Commons was at our fingertips.
We completed two full laps around the expansive dining hall before deciding what to order, noting the elegantly flowing buffet tables and classy raised-table seating arrangements. Reflecting on his first impression of the dining hall, Joe recalled, “It smelled great. Ambiance was great. It was very well-constructed — I would say there was very much a high-class elegance.” In agreement, Ziji added that “it did not feel like a school cafeteria.”
Eventually, though, our appetites overwhelmed our curiosity. Berkshire Dining Commons has a seemingly endless (and sometimes overwhelming) selection of available foods — on Friday night, we could choose from the rotating Chef’s Table, which was serving pork chops and white fish; a sushi bar; a made-to-order stir fry station; wonton bowls; an international cuisine station offering chicken tikka masala and naan; and, of course, the classics: salad bar, pizza, mac and cheese, and herb-roasted chicken. (As Ziji noted, the fact that the pizza and mac and cheese — staples at Valentine Dining Hall — remained largely untouched in a remote corner of Berkshire told us everything we needed to know about the difference between UMass and Amherst dining.) Lastly, one cannot forget about the dessert options: bread pudding, pear cobbler, cranberry bars, and walnut brownies.
Amherst students familiar with UMass dining often describe the stir fry as epitomizing the larger school’s superiority, and it did not disappoint. Following Ziji’s lead, I ordered a stir fry — choosing my preferred veggies and protein — and watched as one of the two stir fry chefs prepared it in front of me. Together with warm white rice, available in adjacent rice cookers, I ate what was easily the best meal that I have had in the past five weeks. In addition to the fact that the stir fry was hot off the pan, the flavorful sauces, fresh vegetables, and tender chicken combined to form what I would declare a college culinary masterpiece.
Ziji, however, was not as impressed with his stir fry. While his specific complaint concerned the lack of variety in stir fry sauces — the only options being soy sauce and hot sauce — he pointed out that he was thinking of the “long-term” experience of eating at UMass: “Eating it once is great. Twice — great. Three times — good. Four times — not as good anymore. Five times — OK. It’s the same flavor with different ingredients in it, which is going to taste the same.”
Joe, who sampled the pork wonton — comprised of broth, lo mein, and vegetables — in addition to the stir fry and pork chops said that his only complaint was that the pork tasted a “bit dry” and that the bacon relish “did not saturate the pork.” Other than that, eating at UMass “was basically the greatest moment of my life in the past trimester,” Joe reported.
The UMass students that I talked to on Friday night echoed Ziji’s opinion of the UMass dining experience. Ruby, a sophomore at UMass Amherst, told me, “I feel like [Berkshire Dining Commons] definitely loses its appeal over time. Last year I feel like it didn’t, but even this year, it’s a really nice rotation and all of the food is really good, but it still is a rotation. So I feel like I get used to it.”
Ziji and Ruby touched on a universal human experience: When one eats a certain food enough times — even something as delicious as a UMass Amherst stir fry — it eventually loses its appeal. This phenomenon is described by the Wundt Curve, named after German philosopher Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt, which maps pleasure as a function of novelty. As the Wundt Curve predicts, experiences that lack novelty will lead to boredom and displeasure.
My takeaway, then, is as follows: How good a college dining hall is on an absolute scale does not matter as much as how well a dining hall curates an interesting and varied selection of meals. Case-in-point: Even the famed UMass dining hall gets old after a time. To create a pleasurable dining experience, the ability to choose from a wide variety of options becomes critical: “I think you have to make sure you’re switching up where you’re going and what you’re getting. Because if you get into a routine, it does kind of feel stale,” UMass sophomore Shane Williams explained.
As we left UMass, feeling so full from our multi-course meal that we did not even sample the dessert options, I asked Ziji and Joe for their final ratings. Ziji, trying to provide an objective rating, hypothesized that arriving to UMass on an empty stomach might have clouded his judgment of the food — he arrived in a “hot state,” as behavioral scientists would describe it. Ziji ultimately rated his meal a respectable 7 out of 10, while Joe rated his meal an impressive 9 out of 10.
Joe, in responding to Ziji’s rating, questioned, “What is the utility of the judgment?” That is, what purpose does it serve to find reasons for critiquing the meal? Why not focus on enjoying the experience? If you want the most accurate rating of the food, free of any bias, then Ziji’s response is likely more reliable. But, if you want the rating that captures the joy of eating at Berkshire Dining Commons, then Joe’s 9 out of 10 is surely the better rating.

2022-10-05,Mass. Insider: Will Kim Driscoll Remember Western Massachusetts?,"
The hard truth for Western Massachusetts public officials is that if you dream of running for state office, you’d better find a new dream. It has been historically almost impossible for anyone from the western side of the state to succeed in a statewide race. There have been no governors or lieutenant governors from Western Massachusetts since Jane Swift became acting governor in 2001. Since a majority of the state’s population lives within about 30 miles of Boston, any candidate living solidly in Eastern Massachusetts has an often insurmountable “hometown” advantage at the state level.
Maura Healey became the nominee for governor because she is known throughout the state and has been for years. Kim Driscoll, who won the lieutenant governor nomination, was the only statewide candidate this cycle to lose almost every city/town in the western part of the state. The current mayor of Salem, Driscoll won a three-way race for the lieutenant governor nomination, prevailing over Longmeadow State Sen. Eric Lesser and Acton State Rep. Tami Gouveia. Lesser was the only western Massachusetts candidate in the race and Gouveia is from Acton, closer to Boston than Longmeadow but not as well known in that region as Driscoll.
As soon as Driscoll entered the race, pollsters deemed her the winner. That was the case up until the state party convention where delegates from local city/town Democratic party branches gather as one to choose who the party wants to endorse. At the convention, Driscoll won 41 percent of the vote compared to Lesser’s 23 percent and Gouveia’s 21 percent. All three candidates made it over the 15 percent delegate vote requirement to make it onto the ballot. Since her announcement at the beginning of the year, the state Democratic party began coalescing around her (see polling section on Lt. Gov race).
Like Maura Healey, Driscoll ran on a platform advocating for better housing, healthcare, and childcare. As in most states, the lieutenant governor has a very obscure job description. In some states, they just preside over the state Senate chamber, while in others they assume complete control of the governorship if the governor so much as steps out of the state’s borders. In Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor chairs the governor’s council — a body of eight members elected from districts across the Commonwealth who vote on the governor’s judicial nominees and give advice. Aside from that, the rest of one’s tenure is more or less spent traveling the state as a kind of publicist for gubernatorial initiatives. All this means that it’s a generally boring position — so why was the field so crowded this year?
Driscoll may want to run for governor or Congress in the future, and proving that she can win statewide is valuable fuel for a campaign. She has been the mayor of Salem — a trendy place to be during the Halloween season. She patiently waited for 16 years to shoot her shot and ultimately made it. Undoubtedly, she will triumph over Leah Cole Allen — the Geoff Diehl-endorsed Republican nominee who shares Diehl’s weaknesses as a far-right candidate. For Western Massachusetts, though, the question is, will she remember us?
It is no secret that Driscoll was trounced in the western part of the state by Lesser, a native of Western Massachusetts. Voters here undoubtedly wanted him to be the lieutenant governor. Unfortunately for him and them, that will not be the case. Losing almost all of four counties does not look good. So, unless Driscoll works to coalesce this region around her, she will alienate this part of the state. I have met Driscoll and talked with her and she doesn’t strike me as the type of person to leave anyone behind. Although residents of Western Massachusetts certainly had a preference for Lesser, Driscoll’s support of the construction of a West-East rail line shows that she values their votes. Indeed, she and Lesser stood side by side in Springfield in support of the project, and Lesser has given a full endorsement of the Healey-Driscoll ticket.
I believe that Driscoll’s loss here has only driven her to want to build more relationships in Western Massachusetts. In the months leading up to the primary she gained some momentum in the region, including the endorsement of the Springfield City Council President as well as some of his colleagues on the council and school committee. The support that she gained in the region, however minor, is proof that she cares about Western Massachusetts residents, and is a foot in the door, so to speak, to gaining allies outside of her Eastern base.
Moreover, Driscoll will have to live up to making relationships here if she plans on running statewide again for a higher office. In 2018, Sen. Warren only defeated her opponent because the western part of the state showed up and out for her. She dominated in the Boston area and its suburbs, but if Western Massachusetts voted for the Republican nominee for Senate with the same enthusiasm with which they voted for Gov. Baker in his race the same year, Warren may have lost. So, there are occasions where Western Massachusetts matters, and our state leaders are beginning to realize that.
I hope Western Massachusetts won’t continue to be forgotten and I feel that it won’t be. Perhaps Sen. Lesser will receive a position in the new administration if the Healey/Driscoll ticket wins the general election. Our governors rarely pick cabinet secretaries from this region, leaving our mayors and city councils to fend for themselves. It is not the case that everyone in the race gets a position, but the state needs someone from Western Mass in Boston to continue helping bridge the divide.

2022-09-28,Mass. Insider: We Desperately Need West-East Rail,"
In my previous articles, I have mentioned gubernatorial hopeful Maura Healey’s commitment to delivering West-East rail if she becomes governor. With this week’s column, I hope to dive into the operations and the development of the rail project and how it benefits the state and Amherst students.
West-East (or East-West if you are from Eastern Massachusetts) rail would be a high-speed rail system starting in Boston, terminating in Pittsfield, and running much faster than the average train. Residents pressured Governor Charlie Baker to start taking the idea seriously at the end of his first term after he vetoed a 2016 study by state Sen. Eric Lesser that arguably could have had the rail complete or almost complete by now. In 2018, the Massachusetts Dept. of Transportation formed an advisory committee to explore the rail line’s cost, benefits, and locations. They released their final report in January of 2021.
One of the many reasons that Gov. Baker has hesitated to support the construction of a West-East rail line is the project’s cost. According to the Dept. of Transportation’s report, the project would come with a price tag of between $2.4 and $4.6 billion — certainly a staggering amount. However, the necessity of the service easily justifies this level of spending.
Boston and its suburbs are workforce hubs in Massachusetts and New England. We need an alternative to driving a car, especially for those who can’t or don’t drive. The report found that anywhere between 900 and 1,500 passengers would utilize the rail system every weekday. If the cost to ride the rail were to be kept cheap, like taking a public bus, it would attract even more passengers who may not want to waste gas money. Western Massachusetts is also a part of the knowledge corridor — a system of colleges and universities that house tens of thousands of students who may want to travel to tourist spots in Eastern Massachusetts. It is also fun to ride a train!
West-East rail would not only be a fancy, fast-moving train. It would be a way to allow residents from all over the state to expand their career options, visit family that they may not have the means to otherwise, and explore the beauty of Massachusetts. Wouldn’t it be nice to get to Boston in 30 minutes rather than spending nearly two hours stuck in traffic? And it is crucial to note that the rail would run through Palmer, Massachusetts, which Amherst students can reach via PVTA in about 25 minutes. From there, students would be able to travel the rest of the state at a fair cost as well as contributing to environmental sustainability by taking a train.
I believe that West-East rail would bring the Commonwealth together socially and economically. Western Massachusetts is usually left out of the conversation. Usually, political leaders do not have to worry about our support because a majority of the state’s population lives east of highway 495 — a major highway that loops from the start of Cape Cod to the top of the state's border with New Hampshire.
In a recent MassLive article supporting the rail system, the authors ask readers to “compare the economic paths of Springfield and Worcester in the past 20 years. What is a major difference between these cities? Passenger rail and proximity to Boston. Reasonably frequent, 90-minute trips have no doubt contributed to the revitalization of Downtown Worcester. Springfield deserves what Worcester already has. Reasonably frequent service and a travel time well under two hours.” A high-speed rail connecting all ends of our state may sew that division and our leaders now have to have us at the table.
Maura Healey has been to Western Massachusetts many times to promote the rail system. When our leaders come together to support a cause that benefits everyone, their constituents generally respond similarly. Not to mention that residents of the eastern part of the Commonwealth are moving west at higher rates than ever before. Western Massachusetts is becoming a critical part of the state, and our leaders are recognizing that. I believe there will be a day where technological and industrial redevelopment will bring Western Massachusetts back to life, and the West-East rail is just the beginning.
However, there is still a lot to be said about the price tag. West-East rail will cost Massachusetts more than the U.S. Dept. of Transportation will allocate to the state for the beginning developments of the rail based on the final page of the report. The Massachusetts Dept. of Transportation has been working closely with our congressional delegation to find alternative ways to fund the project. Western Massachusetts Congressman Richard Neal may play a key role in securing those funds, as he is in charge of one of the most influential financial committees in Congress. According to a recent MassLive article, “Funding from the $1 trillion federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill will be available starting in mid-2022. The law, which Neal championed in his role as chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, includes $66 billion for Amtrak nationwide and $2.5 billion for public transit in Massachusetts.”
Also, while in Springfield, Healey repeated her plan to place an executive in charge of the West-East rail development. The study has concluded, and if Maura Healey takes the governor’s office, West-East rail may become a reality.

2022-09-28,Rants and Raves: Peering Out of the Fishbowl,"
It’s that time of year again. With the brisk autumn breeze come to the Amherst campus, in hordes and droves, the most academically gifted, extracurricularly involved, and altogether presentable students the New England prep-school circuit (and a handful of impressively endowed public schools) has to offer. And their parents.
Thankfully the college has a convenient method for corralling these keen kids: the prospective student tour. The basic form is simple and infinitely replicable. At a scheduled time on a scheduled date, Amherst-interested youth and their parental unit(s) meander down to the admissions office and embark upon a leisurely and meticulously planned stroll across campus, hitting all the key spots (a not-decrepit dorm [e.g., not Cohan], Val [notably not the food], the strikingly scenic view from atop Memorial Hill) while an exuberant student tour guide (invariably an extrovert, often a theater aficionado) runs through every admissions-brochure cliche possible to cram into a 45-minute period (drink when you hear “around half of students take a Five College class,” “the open curriculum — you never have to take a math class ever again,” or “we are now approaching the best — and only, haha — dining hall on campus”). Going on a tour is basically like downing a smoothie-blend of all the promises that admissions officers make when trying to sell you on Amherst.
But the way we campus inhabitants experience the tours is quite different. Each morning, I awake to a monologue about the merits of PVTA-ing to Mount Holyoke outside my third-floor Morrow window — apparently, it’s not worth it. I can only hear the soliloquy because of the grainy max-volume microphones they use even when the tour is all of eight people and which make them sound like rabid-bulldog political organizers rallying in support of the right to bore me to death.
The upside: The tours have massively improved my patience for trudging behind slow-moving crowds. With inexplicable precision, the ambling clusters seem to have learned my class schedule; they clog the requisite pathways, trailing behind their backwards-walking tour guide (“Be sure to let me know if I’m about to hit something” — toothy smile — “All right, guys?”) in a manner and speed not unlike the eponymous stumblers of AMC’s “The Walking Dead.”
By far my most unsettling regular encounter with tourers is when I sense their coolly appraising gaze catch on me. I think I know how the monkeys at the zoo feel. Or the fish at my dentist’s office. I’ll be in Val, snacking and working, and I glance to the window only to see an old man in a brand-new mammoth hat staring back. He’s unashamed, as if behind a one-way mirror. (“Observe, kiddo, the Amherst student in his natural habitat. Isn’t it marvelous how he types his essays, with the simple carefree air that only a liberal-arts-college student can muster? Isn’t nature beautiful?” I imagine he says.)
I want to be clear: Neither the tour guides nor the prospective students are the object of my mild annoyance. The former are just doing their job, and in a sense so are the latter. The college itself is responsible for the lethargic, disconcerting propaganda machines that are the prospective student tours. (Ragging on the college is passé, but tragically still a necessity.) They seem to exist primarily as a way to influence the way these possible future application statistics see the college; I think it incredibly likely that the high-schoolers would learn more about Amherst just walking around on their own, free of the filter: schlepping their way through the Cohan basement, peeking nervously through the window of abandoned and dilapidated Merrill, and, I’m sure, still ending up atop Memorial Hill to watch the purple-tinted sunset over the Holyoke Range.
While my qualms with the tours themselves are real, in writing this rant I think I’ve stumbled onto an explanation buried deep in my subconscious for why they bother me so much. To put my cards on the table, I’m one of the very prep-school brats I’m referencing (albeit from Texas rather than New England), and my junior spring break was spent gazing up at the high towers and pointed arches of all the elite East Coast colleges that you can reasonably visit in a two-week period. So having to see the tours and hear all the admissions cliches takes me back to a time when I was preoccupied with securing a successful future, which I tied heavily to getting into one of said elite East Coast colleges. They’re an unwelcome reminder.
But my cynicism belongs only to me. In the true spirit of the issue perhaps I should return to my student-tour qualms with fresh eyes and try to approach the admissions process with an ounce of charity — after all, where would I be without my Mammoth pride?

2022-09-28,I Delete Emails Every Day,"
I have created more than 10 email accounts over the course of my 21 years on Earth, each for a different reason: one account for personal use, another account for personal use but with a better email address, an account for receiving newsletters and advertisements, an account for my prospective business that never had the chance to take off.
No matter what intention lies behind any of these accounts, they all bring me the same problem: old and unwanted emails.
Even after I finish deleting the 67 items in my spam, the “Updates,” “Forums,” and “Promotions” tabs follow. With the advent of these new tabs, I can no longer rely on the “Select All” square that allows me to mass-tick and mass-delete all at once — some of my most important emails arrive under the “Updates” and “Forums” tabs.
I’ve hit the point, not once but many times, where I’ve been warned that I could no longer send or receive messages because I’d reached my 15GB Google storage limit. This happened several times when I was in high school, at extremely critical times: times when I was waiting for emails from organizations I had applied to or simply approached for a spot of volunteering, and admissions offices’ answers to my questions about the Common App and English language test scores. I was always in a hurry to clear up spams and old conversations to make space for these priorities at the time. Looking back, I knew I didn’t need to surround myself with the worst scenarios, but at the time, those small things, if left unattended, could build up into big piles of troubles that would eventually alter the future that I always wanted.
Then came my first two years of college. I was always worried that I would miss out on one of the biggest college events or fail to comply with new policy — say, updated masking protocols — by missing one email, perhaps an email blocked from reaching my already full mailbox. Having three to four email accounts helped a lot with this crisis because I had a clear idea of which email would be sent to which account (plus, they’re nice back-ups to your primary account), though sometimes I particularly focused on some accounts and neglected the responsibility of taking care of the rest, which weighed on my conscience until I sat down and tidied my inboxes.
But a clogged email is not just a source of personal inconvenience — the planet suffers too. Mike Berners-Lee, a professor at Lancaster University’s Environment Centre and advisor of 2019 research commissioned by OVO Energy, says that while sending an email already requires electricity, having it stored in our mailbox requires even more energy, since this information needs to be kept in the Cloud. By sending less polite replies and emptying your trash often, you prevent these “pointless” emails from clogging up your system and contributing to carbon emissions. While I am still working on the former because the exchange of pleasantries is essential in some conversations, I am diligent about the latter because all it needs is a short five minutes of my time every morning.
I started to regularly clean up my Gmail more often two years ago. A few management tools I use now to complement my tech habits are Unroll.me and clearfox.io, and they were true helpers that got me off the subscribers’ list of companies I didn’t care about but allowed me to keep receiving emails with headlines like “We think this is something you might like.”
While learning to delete emails habitually was at first an unpleasant experience, I can now envision myself winning at a future workplace for how responsive I am to emails. Weaving these facts and fantasies together, I am happy to have had a deep and emotional engagement with this seemingly ubiquitous e-tool. Deleting emails feels so therapeutic when you have time on your hands, but you need a warm-up activity to actually start doing everything on your to-do list. What’s strikingly clear is how pushing myself to maintain this practice on a daily basis allows me to intuitively track my personal development with something that is a dime a dozen like emails. As the saying goes, you end up mastering a thing that had consistently concerned you in the past.
After going through these emails, I can just sit back, relax, and feel good about the virtual burden that I independently shrugged off of my little shoulders. Now, the fact that this tiny action helps prevent excess carbon emission adds more weight to this commitment.
Amherst College students receive at least one email per day courtesy of the Daily Mammoth. Other emails come incessantly from administrators, Google Calendar invitations, newsletters from Management Consulted talking about their newest case prep program and free drills giveaway. It’s about time we act like the female lead in a K-drama, tie our hair up in a ponytail, and start nurturing that habit of decluttering our inboxes regularly.

2022-09-21,Fall in Love With the Pioneer Valley,"
With fall just a day away, the Editorial Board is practically bursting in anticipation of fire-red trees and a nippier breeze. The excitement is so great, in fact, that we spent an entire editorial meeting discussing our favorite places to go and things to do this season. We’ve starred with a little asterisk (*) places that are accessible by walking (and often biking) or the PVTA, and we hope that you all get a chance to get off campus this fall and enjoy the crisp air!
Hiking ’n’ the Great Outdoors
Amethyst Brook* is incredibly close to campus, with the Robert Frost trail starting right off the bus stop. Our very own wildlife sanctuary* is even closer, but other popular hiking and walking spots in the area include Mt. Sugarloaf, Mt. Tom, and Puffers Pond,* among many others. Amherst Outing Club conducts many free hiking, whitewater rafting, kayaking, mountain biking and other outdoor activities this season, so be sure to sign up! And the bike path, always classic, is especially beautiful this time of year.
Farms ’n’ Harvests
Don’t forget to take advantage of the many, many farms nearby! Aside from our own Book and Plow, Atkins Farms Country Market*, with its cider donuts and cheesecake stuffed apples, is a certified cultural heritage site in Hampshire County, and New Salem Cider is worth traveling to for their picturesque orchards and lovely cider garden.
Speaking of orchards, Hampshire County has a ton of picking possibilities! For apple picking, be sure to check out Kielbasa Orchards* or Park Hill Orchard. Park Hill also has “Art in the Orchard,” a walking sculpture trail winding through the fruit gardens. Fletcher Farm has a ton of activities in their pumpkin patches, including scavenger hunts and pumpkin picking, and Mike’s Maze has corn mazes, pedal cars, and hay rides.
Fests ’n’ Events
Our very own Fall Fest takes place yearly on campus and features festive snacks alongside such autumnal events as pumpkin carving and (last year, at least) ferris-wheel riding. Belchertown Fair & Parade runs Sept. 23-25, Northampton’s Jazz Festival* starts on September 30 and ends the following day, the North Quabbin Garlic & Arts Festival (a farm favorite!) runs Oct. 1-2, and the Farmers’ Market* on the town common runs every Saturday morning until 1:30 p.m. until November. Also in town is the Apple Harvest Festival, taking place on Sept. 28.
Cozy Places
As the weather gets chillier, here are a few cozy places to spend an afternoon (or full day!) at. The Montague Bookmill & Cafe has excellent sandwiches, Share coffee, and snug couches overlooking an incredible view — though it is arguable that both the Unnameable Books* in town and Raven Used Books* in Northampton have better used book selections. It has been said that the Pie Bar in Florence has the best (and possibly the most expensive) pie in New England, and cozy spots abound in the area, from the famous Esselon Cafe* in Hadley to Haymarket Cafe* and Wood Star Cafe* in Northampton to the menagerie of coffee shops and delis in town.
Cooler Desserts
While the temperatures are dropping, it isn’t too late to grab a scoopbite of ice cream, especially as the many ice cream places in the area offer new autumnal flavors.! Grab some fancy grocery items along with the best ice cream in the Valley at Hadley Scoop at the Silos*, though it is a bit of a walk from the rail trail or the nearest bus stop. Or, if you prefer a more difficult commute, you can always go to Flayvors. Both have a chalkboard offering discounts based on your name (a list which changes frequently), and Herrell’s,* in Northampton, will give you a free sundae on your birthday. For those venturing farther away, Mt. Tom’s,* in Easthampton, has a lovely selection of candies as well as some of the best specials in the valley.
Spooky Attractions
As Halloween peeks over the horizon, it's worth checking out Fear on the Farm’s haunted hayrides at McCray’s Farm, DementedFX’s* haunted house experience in Holyoke, or Salem’s own Ghost Tours and Witch Walks for some extra historical horror. Be sure to watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show* at Amherst Cinema on Halloween (and any other horror movies they have – Amherst students have free screenings after 9 p.m.PM). Visit Emily Dickinson’s Grave* (and check out the museum!) right in town or Mary Lyon’s grave* at Mount Holyoke. Make a costume (and if you have an ESA, dress it up!), go trick or treating, carve pumpkins and enjoy Pioneer Valley Fall!

2022-09-21,The Problem With the Bruce Bogtrotter Competition,"
Content warning: This article contains mentions of eating disorders.

This past weekend, Amherst’s women’s sports teams had initially planned to gather for their annual Bruce Bogtrotter cake-eating competition. Reflecting on the fact that a similar event at Tufts University led to a young woman choking and dying last fall, the organizers decided to cancel this year’s competition the night before it was set to occur. Last year’s tragedy at Tufts was not the only reason that the event should have been canceled, however. The concerns we raise below are ones that have been heard for years in conjunction with the event, and we hope that this year’s cancellation can encourage all of us to think more critically about the competition and the broader culture at Amherst that it represents.
In addition to safety concerns surrounding the event, the Bruce Bogtrotter competition also perpetuated a culture of disordered eating among female athletes. The event, which gets its name from the classic scene in Roald Dahl’s “Matilda,” was a cake-eating competition aimed at finding out which team could eat an entire sheet cake the fastest. The event was organized by the women’s ice hockey team, and each team, after paying an entry fee (covering the cost of the cake), would choose four participants who partner up to eat in four-minute intervals. Additionally, a fifth team member could serve as a “celebrity” cake-eater who would sub in for a minute at any time. It was common for women to prepare for the event by barely eating all day, then throwing up everything they have eaten soon after the event ends. From this image, it shouldn’t be hard to see the ways in which this event promoted disordered eating behaviors and was triggering for people with backgrounds of disordered eating.
The event was touted as a time for female sports teams to come together and enjoy healthy competition. It is, to our knowledge, the only recurring event at Amherst designed with this purpose. It is ironic, then, that the event is so deeply tied up in perpetuating a culture of disordered eating. While people of all ages and gender identities can and do experience disordered eating, a 2015 American Counseling Association study shows that women in their late teens and early twenties (the exact demographic of most Bruce Bogtrotter participants) are particularly at risk. Moreover, women who spend a lot of time with other similarly aged women, such as those on sports teams, are the most at risk because the constant close proximity means we’ll hear many comments our teammates make about their bodies, exercise habits, and diets.
As members of the women’s crew team, we have been making a concerted effort over the past few years to shift this culture by including guidelines for speaking about these topics in our team expectations and participating in relevant programming through the Counseling Center. Before Bruce Bogtrotter each year, the captains of our team would often send a message informing us of the triggering nature of the event. Why, then, if we know what this event perpetuates, did our teams continue to promote it for so long? It seems that the answer, as it so often is, is that it was a tradition. But what does it say about the culture at Amherst that we find it so difficult to step away from tradition, even when we know there is something wrong with the tradition?
Bruce Bogtrotter was scheduled fairly early in the academic year. For many first-years, the event came at a time when they didn’t have a solidified friend group yet and felt like they needed to participate in all the social events they could. Athletes on club teams, like ours, had only joined the team a week or two before the event occurred, and they were eager to participate in any event that the team sponsored. What does an event like this tell these first-years about athletics at Amherst, and the way Amherst supports and treats women?
We don’t write this article thinking that much of what we argue here will be a new perspective to many people, especially not for female athletes. We know it isn’t, because we’ve heard these conversations behind closed doors for years. We hope instead that the decision made to cancel Bruce Bogtrotter this year can become an opportunity to have these conversations more publicly, and to ensure that Bruce Bogtrotter does not return in the coming years.

2022-09-21,"Mass. Insider: Our Politics Are Weird, But Changing","
Why does the Commonwealth of Massachusetts elect Republican governors despite voting consistently Democratic on the federal level? It is a phenomenon that occurs in other states, but why specifically in one of the bluest in the country?
Massachusetts voters are known for electing progressive federal representatives. Sen. Elizabeth Warren champions bold economic reform to rebuild the middle class. Sen. Ed Markey advocates for the Green New Deal. Rep. Richard Neal wrote most of the federal child tax credit. Rep. Jim McGovern champions ending child hunger, Rep. Ayanna Pressley fights for police reform, Assistant Speaker of the House Rep. Katherine Clark supports universal pre-K, and so on. We have a completely Democratic federal delegation, and all of our other statewide offices are held by Democrats as well. The national Republican party collectively opposes anything progressive-seeming — so why is it that Republicans fare so well in the Massachusetts Governorship?
Voters in Massachusetts tend to base their vote on who they like, rather than on a specific policy platform. Policy is of course a factor, but in a state that is generally more liberal, electoral results frequently fall down to the character of the people running. Gov. Charlie Baker may be a Republican, but his personal appeal to even the most liberal of Democrats is what has allowed him to triumph.

Baker has been labeled as a liberal Republican, and many in his own party have called him a RINO (Republican-in-name-only) for straying away from the Republican party’s national agenda. He is personable, humble, and oftentimes sides with Democratic talking points. Along with claiming that abortion is a human right that must be upheld, he has also signed a major climate bill negotiated by the Democratic supermajority in the state legislature. This allows him to be seen as an unconventional Republican even in the bluest parts of the state. In 2018, Baker won almost every major liberal city and their suburbs (Springfield, Worcester, Easthampton, etc.). He even narrowed the election in Boston down to less than one point — the closest any Republican gubernatorial candidate has come to winning the very blue city since Bill Weld won it in 1994.
But the success of Republican candidates in gubernatorial races has not helped their chances on the Congressional stage. In 2018, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s re-election ran alongside the governor’s election. She beat her opponent by 24 pts even as the Republican Baker retained the governorship by over 30 pts. While the Republican party in Massachusetts has been shifting to the right in recent years, a majority of our Republican governors have run on a fiscally conservative but socially liberal platform. (This is the case in other states such as New Hampshire and Vermont as well, but it is unique in Massachusetts because of our heavily Democratic population). Baker has signed climate bills and abortion rights into law but hesitated on funding a West-East rail line because of its cost.
Republican governors have fared so well here because they connect with voters personally, but they also don’t play to the tune of their party’s national agenda. Baker opposed Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court, a social stance that probably made him more popular in the state precisely because it ran against party rhetoric. However, the ability for politically successful Republican governors to exist outside of their party’s mainstream may soon disappear.
Electing the Trump-endorsed Geoff Diehl as the Republican nominee for governor was the worst decision Republican voters here could have made. As the MAGA movement continues to infiltrate historically moderate Republicans such as the ones in Massachusetts, their ability to win in blue states may be coming to an end. Charlie Baker’s personal likability and moderate-policies allowed him to appeal to independents and Democrats and become one of the most popular governors in the country — but Geoff Diehl can’t have that appeal. As I mentioned in my first article, Democratic nominee Maura Healey can argue that he will alienate residents that disagree with him because of his far-right ideology. Healey, on the other hand, seems to be continuing the tradition of appealing to all voters personally while not forgetting to promote what is popular in the state.
Healey’s campaign took a while to release specific policy items even after it started. She instead appealed to voters by first sympathizing with them — relating to them. Her pitch is that she is the product of a single, working mother, who worked her way to the top on her own and understands teamwork and struggle based on her upbringing. That pitch alone is enough to attract almost all single, working mothers in the Commonwealth to Healey’s side without her necessarily having to release specifics on how she plans to support single mothers. (Those specifics, however, did come later and are now all over her website.) Healey is a Democrat, but her lack of policy promotion and emphasis on relating to residents’ struggles echoes the argument that on the state level, gubernatorial candidates don’t have to play to the tune of their party’s agenda to win.
I believe that there can be a balance. I also believe that achieving policy goals is more important than blindly promising them. Healey has worked with the legislature for almost a decade and has built the relationships necessary to be a transformative governor. If Maura Healey were not the Democratic nominee, I would probably have voted for Baker if he ran for a third term. But I would not vote for Baker if he were ever a Senate candidate. That would give the national Republican party more power federally. Republicans here and in other states can be checked and balanced by the state legislature on policy, but federally they are pressured to appeal to a party agenda more than to the people’s individual needs.
Regardless of political affiliation, research all of the candidates running where you are voting. Vote for whom you believe will deliver the bold and reformative social and fiscal results that you want to see.

2022-09-21,Rants and Raves: Frost Findings,"
Frost Library is my default study space. I can spend hours in a cubicle writing a paper, relax in a comfy chair doing my reading, or get a Buzzed Banana smoothie from Frost Cafe. Even when I’m not finishing homework, I’m still in the library, working as an employee at the front desk or between the stacks. After spending a year exploring all that Frost has to offer, I’ve learned about the many ways students can use the library, including opportunities they may be unaware of.
While this may be obvious to upperclassmen, some newer students may be unaware that you can request books from any of the Five Colleges and have them delivered to Amherst within a few days. Once you’re finished, you can also drop them off here, instead of traveling to another campus. However, if you are visiting UMass’s Du Bois Library (the third tallest library in the world!) or are stopping by another campus, you can use your Amherst ID to check out books. If none of the Five Colleges have what you’re looking for, you can place a loan request online to either have the book shipped from another library through the Interlibrary Loan system or submit a purchase request. If there’s any possible way for Frost Library to get material you need, they will deliver it right to you.
The library has more resources than just class materials. There are a number of leisure books available, with an entire section of manga, graphic novels, and fiction. The DVD collection is housed on A Level, and if you’ve gotten rid of your DVD player, you can watch films in Frost at the screening stations next to the collection. And if you’re in a pinch, you can also check out phone and laptop chargers from the front desk.
Frost offers a number of digital resources as well, including the citation service Zotero, which you can use to help create a digital bibliography. With some of Frost’s other digital tools, you can learn a language on Mango, stream media from around the world, learn all about birds, and explore Ancestry.com’s library, all through your Amherst account. If you’re having trouble sifting through the databases, you can always come chat with a research librarian, available at the front desk, or make an appointment to have an in-depth session. The Archives & Special Collections are an additional resource for research, but if you can’t visit in person, you can always browse their digitized collection.
Perhaps the most significant change that Frost has made this year is becoming a fine-free library. In order to facilitate equity amongst the Amherst community, no fines will be incurred for late materials. That means that if you’re in a class and unable to return a reserve book in the allotted four hours, you won’t be charged a fine, as in the past. This also applies to other materials, which typically have a three month loan period for students. If you have any questions, you can always come to the front desk, where a worker will be glad to help you. Frost Library has an incredible array of resources, from free printing on A Level to study rooms available for reservation and course materials behind the front desk. Make sure that you take advantage of them!

2022-09-14,Three Stories Down: Reflections From the Catacombs,"
When I think of the most solitary place on the Amherst campus, I think of the Catacombs. For the uninitiated, “the Catacombs” is the macabre name bestowed upon Frost basement’s deepest level. It’s home to many, many books — and a select handful of dauntless studiers.
The space itself is a maze of poorly lit book shelving. The wall nearest to the front entrance and those perpendicular to the shelves are plastered brick, pock-marked by age. The back wall, bone-white, features many tiny perforations, presumably for some insulatory purpose. I find them concerningly reminiscent of the breathing holes one pokes into the temporary home of a birthday-gifted shih tzu.
The ceiling of the room (perhaps glimpsed with your head thrown back in despair) is a scuffed gray. Just below it lies an exposed grid of ventilation passages, pipes, and wires, which at least suggests the Catacombs has little to hide.
With its pattern of varicolored lines, the design of the carpeting echoes the maze motif of the shelving. Luckily, the abundance of well-placed “exit” signs assuage any fears of becoming hopelessly lost amid the literary labyrinth.
I don’t mean to give the impression that the Catacombs are completely inhospitable. Some kind soul thought to line the front wall with wooden cubicle desks and pepper the outskirts of the labyrinth with a few group-work desks. This might even make you think that person-to-person connection occurs here.
But in the Catacombs, silence is the highest law. The only sounds heard are the dull hum of the air conditioning and the occasional beeps which signal the shelves’ movement as they collapse together to open up one row and close another. A series of laminated yellow signs cautions, “Check for people between shelves.” One can only wonder what grave incident preceded their addition, and whether the unlucky party dared break the one law — or simply accepted their fate.
Time is a concept with which the Catacombs are unconcerned. No clock chimes out on the hour. The room sits deep enough in the Earth to prevent the infiltration of any of the sun's rays. And several black-and-white photos of the Amherst campus — the only sanctioned visual art in the room — secure the space’s sense of timelessness.
The morbid moniker “the Catacombs” may strike some as over-exaggerated — the room is just underground, after all. But it seems more apt when you consider the primary inhabitants of the space: the books themselves. As the walls of the actual French Catacombs are lined with the bones of several million long-dead Parisians, our Catacombs serve as the sepulchral home for the life’s work of not quite as many authors. A wasteland of ideas only occasionally scavenged by the intrepid researcher.
Now the kicker: This bleak, foreboding, downright creepy graveyard of thought is my preferred study spot on the Amherst campus.
The way I see it, there’s something perfectly fitting about doing your coursework in such an unnatural environment. For a brief spell, you can remove yourself from the technicolor social world of pleasant chatter and wide smiles, and escape into the Catacombs — where other people don’t exist, time is inconsequential, and the only voice to be heard is the one inside your head. The gruel of essay writing or problem-set solving makes the most sense to me in this sort of individual unreality.
And sometimes a little isolation or a little silence is simply what you need.
But while I’m frequently the only living body in the Catacombs on a Sunday night — excluding the Sunday directly before finals week — I never feel entirely alone. The cubicle desks, my preferred haunts, are home to numerous messages and drawings, which have been, one can only imagine, etched in extreme boredom by decades of Amherst students.
These include the encouraging (“U got this!”), the poetic (“The wood are lovely, dark and deep…”), the illustrative (including an intricate rendering of a tree, courtesy of the Amherst Botany Club), the profound (“WE ARE ALL POT SMOKERS”), and, too frequently, the pessimistic (“You can’t do it”).
And sometimes, down in the Catacombs, this is the concern that interrupts my solitary page-flipping. Can I do it? Can anyone do it?
To the right of the cynic’s scribble, some later commentator has appended the word “Alone.”
To that, another says, “bet,” and one more still, “PREACH!”
While isolation allows us to focus on our work, or partake in a healthy amount of introspection, it’s our relationships with others, even the faceless shadows of the Catacombs, that ultimately assure us of the worth of our efforts.
So my stay in the Catacombs must always come to an end. I place the final touches on my assignment, collect my things, and head for the heavy metal door. As I ascend the winding staircase to the world of the living, I’m sure not to look back — I’m confident that my wits and my sanity trail just behind."
2022-09-14,Mass. Insider: Maura Healey’s Bid For Governor,"
On Tuesday, Sept. 6, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey became the Democratic nominee for Governor in the state’s primary election, winning with over 85% of the vote. Other primary wins included lieutenant governor nominee Kim Driscoll who is currently the mayor of Salem, Massachusetts, who will appear with Healey on the first ever all-women ticket in Massachusetts history. Attorney General nominee Andrea Campbell may be the first Black woman elected to a statewide office. The auditor and treasurer nominees are also women.
Healey’s only contender, State Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, dropped out of the race months before the primary, but her name remained on the ballot because she dropped out too late to have her name removed. Chang-Diaz cited a lack of funding and momentum being a reason for leaving the race. Though she was originally contested, Healey has the energy, popularity, name recognition, and cash on hand to potentially win the governorship. She would become only the second Democratic Governor of Massachusetts since Michael Dukakis left office in 1991, with the first being Deval Patrick (who served as governor from 2007 to 2015). She would also be the first elected female governor of the Commonwealth, as well as the first openly gay governor of any U.S. state (she would share that title with Tina Kotek of Oregon if she wins her own gubernatorial race there this cycle).
While the state is famous for sending progressive firebrands to Congress like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts has a long history of electing Republican governors and lieutenant governors to keep an eye on the heavily Democratic state legislature. Most other statewide offices have been held by Democrats while a Republican held the top job.
Interestingly, many Democrats who have run for governor and lost first served as attorney general in the state. The most recent examples are Martha Coakley in 2014, Tom Riley in 2006, Scott Harshbarger in 1998, and Frank Bellotti in 1990, although other instances date back to 1966.
Many factors could have shifted past election cycles in favor of the Republicans who trampled their attorney general opponents. These past candidates may not have campaigned well. They may have been unpopular at the time, and the political climate of the Commonwealth previously looked more moderate. What makes this race different from earlier campaigns, however, is the national political climate and the differences in fundraising and name recognition between the candidates eyeing the governor’s office this year. With Healey being the first openly gay woman to seek the governorship in a time when the rights of women and LGBTQ+ folks are at risk, representation may truly matter in this race.
Healey’s Republican opponent, Geoff Diehl, lacks both the name recognition and popularity that Healey can boast. Diehl has been endorsed by former President Trump, which will help him with far-right Republican voters in the state, but may harm his chances with more moderate voters. The more moderate Republican who lost to Diehl in the Primary, Chris Doughty, may have had a better chance in the general election. Doughty could have been another Charlie Baker, who, despite being a Republican, is to date one of the most popular governors in the country.
In contrast, Maura Healey is well-positioned. She has minimal opposition within her own party, and she has several other advantages over Diehl. He has lost in a statewide election before; in the 2018 senate election, Diehl lost to Sen. Warren by around 24 pts. It does not look good to be a perennial candidate. Also, while moderate Republicans like Baker, Mitt Romney, and Bill Weld have succeeded in attracting independents and on-the-line Democrats in past elections, Diehl is far from moderate; Healey has the advantage of arguing that he is too much like Trump and alienates everyone who disagrees with him. At 51 years old, Healey is a spring chicken in political years. She has been all across the Commonwealth — playing basketball with our future leaders, participating in call time with grassroots donors, responding to letters from inspired youth, and not being afraid to discuss the significant issues facing Massachusetts’s future. She champions investments in wind energy, expanding the child tax credit, and making West-East high speed rail connecting Boston to Pittsfield a reality.
By strategically waiting for popular Gov. Baker to opt out, Healey is on her way to becoming the Commonwealth’s next governor. She has a solid chance to break both the attorney general curse that has plagued other gubernatorial aspirations and the decades-long Republican hold on the Governor’s office.
According to polling before the primary, Healey led every candidate by a wide margin (see polling data section), except for the hypothetical matchup between her and Baker where a UMass survey had Baker triumphing. She now leads Diehl by a wide margin in general election polling. She told me in a phone call over the summer that her campaign is centered around grassroots organizing and call-time, the only way to win a campaign at heart and at the ballot box. Seeing that she garnered over 630,000 primary votes to Diehl’s approx. 148,000, she has a strong chance of taking the governor’s seat back as a Democrat.
It is said that the party who holds The White House loses seats during the midterm elections. In a year where the national climate should be on the Republican’s side, the Democratic party stands a real chance of taking back the Massachusetts governor’s seat. The general election is this November — please plan to vote, but if you live in a state where your vote may mean more, stay registered there!

2022-09-14,Caring About the Queen Is Fun: A Hong Kong Story,"
Whenever anything happens with the British royal family, it seems that the inevitable question is, “Who cares?” But the fact is: We do care. On Thursday, Sept. 8, the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, The Student’s opinion editors sent out their weekly email inviting staff to begin writing for next week’s issue. While we were told, as usual, that we could write about anything we wanted to, the email contained a subtle nudge for us to consider writing about the queen. Somehow, it feels like her death must be acknowledged, that a significant portion of the Amherst student population, in one way or another, must care about this piece of news. For this Amherst student, at least, the assumption is correct.
I am not British and have never lived in the U.K. or the Commonwealth, but I do follow the royal family and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (now of Cornwall and Cambridge) on Instagram, and have for years. I am slightly embarrassed to admit this, but, to be fair, most of us follow celebrities in some capacity. Like the Kardashians, the royal family offers lavish displays of wealth, photogenic outfits, dramatic controversy, and a constant output of consumable content. This content mostly involves mediocre speeches and photo ops with happy children. It is not all that substantial or valuable. Often, it is laughable, tone deaf, or even harmful — again, just like the Kardashians. But more than reality stars or Hollywood celebrities, the royal family has an extra hold on me because they are still everywhere in the remnants of Britain’s former empire.
I’m from Hong Kong, a city that has a strange relationship with Britain. There were the Opium Wars, and the Treaty of Nanking, and more movements of trade, war, and empire, after which a tiny island and peninsula in the south of China began to be overseen by governors sent over from London. This happened in the 1840s, but most families who currently live in Hong Kong have only been in the city for two or three generations and have never known a pre-British Hong Kong. For most Hong Kongers, then, there isn’t really a sense of the British having taken over “our land,” which means we could admire the queen’s colorful outfits without much underlying resentment.
The last British governor, Chris Patten, left Hong Kong in 1997. In local retellings, it is much remarked upon that his daughter wept throughout the handover ceremony: She loved Hong Kong so much that she couldn’t bear to leave. Surely, the queen must have been weeping too! For she loved us so much that she gave us the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Elizabeth School, and Queen Elizabeth Stadium, not to mention everything else named after her various ancestors and descendants. My grandmother rarely talks about the British, but whenever she does, she calls the queen by the affection local nickname of 事頭婆 (“grandma at the head of things” or “boss lady”). On balance, there is a schoolchildren’s parody of “God Save the Queen” with the opening line 個個揸住個兜 (“everyone is holding a rice bowl,” i.e., begging for money). I know these stories because my parents would tell me about them in moments of reminiscence, which is to say that despite the complexities of empire, there is a powerful force — collective nostalgia — at play.
In Netflix’s “The Crown,” the fictitious queen stands with her children in front of a globe and points out where her husband, Prince Philip, is traveling on his royal tour. “All these are British Overseas Territories,” she explains, “and they have to be visited every once in a while, so they don’t feel neglected or forgotten, and don’t get any silly ideas like becoming independent.” By my parents’ generation, Hong Kong knew that its relationship with Britain had an expiry date, so there was never an awkward question of whether to fight for independence. For myself, things are even simpler, since the British presence in my city is a thing of the past, and therefore basically unproblematic, or at least non-threatening. The queen is a fairytale figure from “once upon a time,” so whenever she shows up, it feels like a delightful surprise — some leftover fairydust. At school, for example, when we would get change for our lunch, receiving a coin with Elizabeth II’s, or better yet, George VI’s face on it inspired envy, even negotiation and exchange.
My personal interest in the royal family is probably due to their most significant PR event of the 21st century — Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding — happening at just the right moment of my childhood. I was about nine years old and thought that Barbie movies were too babyish for me, but was still obsessed with the idea of princesses. My English had also finally gotten good enough for me to enjoy English-language television. For weeks before the wedding, Hong Kong’s English-language channel seemingly talked about nothing else. I listened to royal commentators recount every aspect of their childhoods and love story, watched Kate Middleton impersonators try on wedding dresses, and learned that, according to a survey (which I’m sure was rigorously conducted), most British men would prefer to go to bed with a blonde, but wake up with a brunette (which is why Prince William was marrying a brunette, of course). The day after the birth of their first child, I was at the dentist’s, where I read newspapers whose entire front pages were taken up by a photo of the royal couple with their newborn. As soon as I was allowed social media, I followed Tumblr pages dedicated to cataloging the royal women’s outfits, shoes, and jewelry. Since then, I’ve watched countless documentaries and enjoyed all the fictional adaptations, like “The Crown” (2016-), “Spencer” (2021), and even the regrettable direct-to-TV movie “William & Kate” (2011).
I am not particularly emotional about the queen’s death. If I were at home right now, I probably would not go to the British consulate with a bunch of flowers or a handwritten note, as some in Hong Kong have done. However, I did spend an hour or so after the announcement refreshing the official Instagram pages and reading coverage. I watched the BBC announcement of the queen’s death so that I could feel a connection — however illusory — to the people who heard George VI’s death announced on BBC radio (it’s probably clear by now that the principal charm of the royal family lies not in their individual personalities, but in the antiquated practices that go along with them). This warm, fuzzy feeling of connection continued when I saw people related to my various interests — like Formula One champion Sir Lewis Hamilton, knitwear designer Marie Wallin, and one of my favorite Instagram accounts, Old HK in Colour — commemorate the queen. This is not to say that the systems of oppression created by the British monarchy and perpetuated (or, at the very least, figuratively represented) by the queen don’t need to be seriously confronted, nor should they be ignored as part of her legacy. I cared about the queen as a megacelebrity, and I care about her death as the end of a symbolic continuity between myself and British Hong Kong. What I really experienced when I heard about the queen’s death was nostalgia. This deceptive feeling imagines a past that did not exist, but when so many of us are suddenly prompted to look back and romanticize together, it sure is fun.
